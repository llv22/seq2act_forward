Go to Settings, About Phone, and click on Software Updates (or something similar). If no updates are available, then try Kies: www?.samsung.com/in/kies/, http://www.samsung.com/us/kies/ , or whichever site version for your region. Install and run Kies. If it does not automatically check and say that there is an update for your phone, look at the options and manually check for updates. If there is an update, follow the instructions it gives.

Reply Ted March 15, 2016 at 1:12 pm No app required Ben. As the article says above, all you do is: Talking Privately During a conference call, you can talk privately with one person during the conference or end a call. To do this, tap on the blue i button on the top-right. This can only be done when all the calls are merged. This article explains it all really well. I hope this helps. Good Luck!

Whenever the iPhone Phone app freezes or stops working properly, quitting the app and opening it again can often fix the problem. Simply switching to another app or returning to your iPhone s home screen won t close the Phone app. You need to swipe up on the screen to bring up all of your open apps and then drag the Phone app up to close it properly. Restart your iPhone . Performing a restart can fix any bugs that are stopping the Phone app from working properly and can be a good solution for when your Phone app keeps crashing. This process can also correct any connection errors you may be having with your cellular provider. Turn Airplane Mode off . If you ve just seen a movie or have been flying, you may have forgotten to switch your iPhone s Airplane Mode off. If on, this feature will prevent anyone from calling you, and keep you from contacting others. Switch Airplane Mode on and off again. If you re having trouble connecting to your mobile carrier, try turning Airplane Mode on, waiting 30 seconds, and then turning it off again. This will reset your connection. Turn on Mobile Data . Swipe down from the top-right corner of your iPhone and check that the Mobile Data icon is green. If it s not, tap it to turn it on. Check your Bluetooth devices. If you re having difficulty hearing phone calls, check all of your Bluetooth speakers and earphones, such as the Apple AirPods , to see if the calls are being diverted to them instead. If this is indeed the case, you may want to try removing the devices from your iPhone or turning your iPhone's Bluetooth off entirely . Are you using the right app? If you suspect that your iPhone Phone app is not working properly or notice that it suddenly looks different, check that you re actually using the correct app. Similar phone and messaging apps such as WhatsApp , Line , WeChat , and Messages have very similar green icons to the one used by the Phone app. Did you pay your mobile bills? It s possible that you may have missed a payment and your mobile carrier has limited your call functionality on your iPhone. Call your provider from another phone or visit a branch to make sure that everything is okay with your account. Check the Slide switch . On the left side of your iPhone is a switch that, when turned on, will completely silent phone calls and notifications. If the switch is orange, this means it s activated. Flick it upwards to turn if off. You should now be able to hear phone calls again on your iPhone. Disable Do Not Disturb Mode . The Do Not Disturb setting has been known to be behind situations when the iPhone Phone app freezes. Reset Network Settings . This can clear up any conflicting data that may be behind your broken iPhone Phone app. Update your iPhone . In addition to adding new features and extra security enhancements, an iOS update can also fix bugs and glitches that have been detected by users and the developers. Do you have a roaming plan? If you re traveling abroad and you re having trouble making a phone call from the iPhone Phone app, it s possible that you might not have global roaming enabled on your smartphone. It s also possible that your carrier may have forgotten to activate it for you so trying checking with them to see if they can spot a cause on their end or with your current plan. Check your SIM card . If you ve been using the same SIM card for a while, it may have finally been worn out and be in need of replacing . Reset your iPhone . This will reset your iPhone to its factory settings and give you a fresh start. Restore your iPhone . This should be considered a last resort as it can result in some data loss. If you ve tried all of the other solutions on this list though, this is well worth trying and is usually effective in fixing a variety of iPhone problems.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/fix-iphone-phone-app-not-working-4797896", "index": 0}

However if I pull the drop down menu down firs I can see that it says there is a usb device plugged in. This however dissappears in about one second, and the keyboard lights just sit there and flash.

As I've been helping few friends finding the best prices for their new laptops few questions came to my mind: - what's a laptop lifespan? - what's the difference in prices? - what machine is more suitable for this friend? I checked that normally a system survives for an average of 4-6 years and that prices for a modest user would be something about 200 to 450 dollars and 900+ for a entry level gaming laptop (yes, you can get one gaming laptop with 500). For students that are really short of money I would highly recommend just get a mini usb keyboard and use it with their phones (or maybe even buying a modest tablet) plus accessory to adjust the phone screen to a better view level. I could safely say that it would be enough for 90% of the people that need a extra computer or even don't have one. Nice post. Reply Jacob W. July 12, 2017 at 8:00 pm I think that USB keyboards that work with Windows computers and with Android phones are awesome. If you have a problem with certain keys (such as the SHIFT, ALT, and CONTROL key) when you have a USB keyboard plugged into your Android device (phone or tablet), like I did, you may be able to solve the problem by doing the following: *For the SHIFT, ALT, and CONTROL key problems, here is the USB Keyboard Shift, Alt, Control key solution/fix that I found: If you want your USB keyboard plugged into your Android device to be fully functional (and get the SHIFT key to work properly, allowing you to capitalize letters and type symbols such as the exclamation mark symbol !, the 'at' symbol @, pound/number symbol/hashtag symbol #, dollar sign symbol $, percent/percentage sign symbol %, carrot symbol ^, the 'and' symbol &, the asterisk/star symbol *, the question mark symbol ?, the colon symbol :, the quotation mark symbol \", etc... as well as get the ALT and CONTROL keys to work so you can do things such as CTRL-C, CTRL-X, CTRL-V, etc.):: *Make sure to download the \"GO Keyboard\" free app from the Google Play app store! When I first bought my USB keyboard and plugged it into my Android phone (a Samsung Galaxy S5), the keyboard worked, but not completely. The shift key and control key didn't work (when I held down the shift key and then pressed letter keys & number keys to capitalize letters & access symbols, it didn't capitalize or type symbols; when I tried to hold down CTRL or ALT and press another key, it didn't do the things that those keys normally do on desktop or laptop PC computers). I tried other keyboard apps (the Samsung keyboard app and Swiftkey Keyboard app), but they didn't allow the Shift key or ALT key to work properly when I plugged in the USB keyboard to my Android phone. After trying to get the keyboard settings to work on my phone (and trying various apps such as the Samsung keyboard/typing app and the Swift Key keyboard/typing app), I finally found that the GO Keyboard app allows everything (including the Control and Alt keys) to work on my USB keyboard when is hooked up to my Android phone. I was so happy that I purchased the \"GO Keyboard Pro\" app (which is the same exact app as the Go Keyboard free app, just without ads) in the Google Play store for 3 bucks, and it also works great! I have no problems with the shift key, control key, or alt key now! Problem solved! Issue fixed. The track pad on USB keyboards is really cool is really cool (it not only allows you to control the cursor on your PC desktop or laptop computer, but it ALSO allows you to have a mouse cursor on your Android phone or tablet! How awesome is that?), but a word of caution: If you are like me and accidentally rest the palm of your hand on the track pad (& accidentally brush your hand/palm against the trackpad, making the cursor move without you wanting to move it), don't worry! You can fix this 'hand touching the track pad' problem too! Just hold down the blue \"Fn\" function key, just to the right of the left-side \"Ctrl\" control key (located at the bottom left corner of the keyboard) and then click on the right-side \"Alt\" key (just to the right of the Space bar key at the bottom of the keyboard, which has a 'mouse/cancel sign on top of a mouse' blue symbol right above the \"Alt\" key letters). This will activate/deactivate the track pad, which is very useful. I have used this feature many times to turn on & turn off the track pad, depending on if I want to use it or not. USB keyboards like the one I purchased are perfect for those like me who want a portable keyboard for both their Android phone (or tablet) and their Windows/PC desktop or laptop computer. You can get an excellent, high quality, great product that is thin, lightweight, super portable, easy to put in your laptop bag or other carrying bag/case, easy to transport, made of good quality materials, lies flat on a desk/table/surface, is comfortable to type on, doesn't feel too small or cramped, types well, the keys type smoothly, the keys don't stick, is very durable and types quietly, doesn't beep or make noises, is quiet, and overall a has great price for the quality - you can get a lot of value for the price. I love my USB keyboard (that works with my Android phones and my Windows computer) a lot, but just know that USB keyboards can have quirks (e.g. the problem of shift, ctrl, & alt key not working properly on Android devices, which you can easily solve by downloading the Go Keyboard app for free; the problem of the track pad being easy to press accidentally, which you can easily solve by turning off the track pad).

I can literally connect just about ANY USB peripheral to my Lumia 950. It has a USB type-C connector, and finding a type-C male to type-A female adapter was cheap, even supporting 3.0 SuperSpeed. The phone also runs Windows 10, making it compatible with almost everything. Keyboard? Mouse? They just work, no fiddling. Thumb drive? Plug it in, go to File Explorer, and have a look around. Need more USB things connected? Any USB hub will work too. Why would you want to use all these peripherals with a phone? Well, Windows 10 has Continuum, which means the phone goes into \"Desktop Mode\" when it detects normal desktop PC peripherals, making it work very much like a traditional computer. Even the usual Windows keyboard shortcuts still work. So, yeah Windows phone FTW. Reply Nemacol August 11, 2016 at 2:52 pm But on the other hand, once you have a keyboard, thumb drive, or any other USB device connected, you are still left with a Windows Phone. I am sure it will be fun to use your keyboard those tens of apps you have available. Reply Rohin June 25, 2016 at 11:11 am I got the OTG, can type and stuff.

I can connect upto a 2TB hdd, a key board and mouse. I actually have a special adapter as well (male microUSB to 3 female USB ports and 1 male USB port). Remember some things that you want to connect require power above what the device can provide and thw device battery will drain fairly quick and the male USB port is useful because you can have it permanently on charge. Some items that I connect require the connection to a power source to work The other item that is handy to get is a similar to your normal thumb hdd, that is it has a male usb connection, but it has a male microUSB connection on the other side. You can get these that are the size of a cigarette butt. Samsung has truly made there devices able to connect to anything. Apple have very limited capacity for this type of connectivity or they make it difficult to do this. I am currently working on connecting my Casio digital piano to my tablet.

Neither would recognize the keyboard or work at all. Anyone have and idea why? Reply erez March 7, 2013 at 10:42 am One option could be due to the keyboard's voltage draw. Is it a completely regular, garden-variety keyboard? Or is it fancy/unique in any way? I would suggest trying with a different keyboard. I don't know if the Prevail supports OTG but I'm pretty sure the S2 does. Reply Tim March 28, 2013 at 5:30 am An obvious question would be whether you are using a genuine OTG cable. In a post on 28 November, Drew Butler suggested, \"The Galaxy Tab 2 has a proprietary usb connector so what you need to do it would be a usb male to female converter used in conjunction with the usb data cable that came along with your tablet.\" That is initially what I had thought also, but was unsuccessful. As soon as I got hold of a genuine OTG cable (ordered online for under $2.00) I could connect both the keyboard and the thumb drive to my Galaxy S II - although obviously not at the same time. Incidentally, hitting the back button did not get rid of the Swype keyboard, but I did find that if I rotated the phone the Swype keyboard would disappear and I could still type on the USB keyboard.

I know that since I got a Nexus 7 without a microSD card slot getting this to work was very important to me. Fortunately it is working with me. I even got a nice little add-on for this project that makes the OTG cable with attached storage smaller than a thumb drive. I bought a USB adapter for a microSD card that is just the nub of the USB and the microSD goes inside the front of the USB adapter. Well take a look for yourself. It works well for me. It is the \"elago Mobile Nano II USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader\" on Amazon.com Reply Erez Zukerman November 29, 2012 at 12:41 pm That's such a brilliant little device! So cool! Anonymous November 29, 2012 at 5:19 pm Isn't that cool? And it works perfectly with my Nexus 7 and my OTG cable. I was thinking about doing some DIY hacking to make this into an even smaller/flat cable that would plug into the Nexus 7, lay flat on the back of the device and provide another port to connect to power simultaneously. Ron W. November 28, 2012 at 5:00 pm I've been able to connect USB drives to my Galaxy S2 SGH-T989 via OTG - when it was running stock, unrooted (for T-Mobile) and now CM10. But the mount points are at different locations (I can't recall what they are). I also may have been lucky with the cable - it's an inexpensive one but maybe the capability depends on the cable. Reply Anonymous November 28, 2012 at 6:51 pm True, I connected a thumbdrive to a Note 2 and a Nexus 7 using the OTG cable but I did buy one of the more expensive $7-$10 cables, so that may be the problem if people are unable to connect to USB drives.

Reply Drew Butler December 1, 2012 at 5:50 am To elaborate. My comment was wrong to a degree, Android has supported standard HID devices since froyo but to an extremely limited capacity. Only a handful of devices will work with keyboards or mice without having ICS and my comment was an attempt to steer people away from spending money on something that wouldn't work for them right out of the box. ICS brings the capability to use all sorts of peripherals and plug and play use for keyboards, mice, and game controllers on all devices running 4.0+ A lot can be done too mod anything, I modded my last Moto Photon 4g so that I could dual boot Ubuntu or an unofficial version of Jellybean. When you used that with a usb hub and an hdmi cable I always had a pc with 1 terra of storage wherever I went...My backup Photon is completely Gingerbread and will not run a KB or mouse via USB but will using Bluetooth Anyways...

The above comment was a correction to my previous comment.(it just means my Motorola Photon 4g is the stock version of android that my phone came with which is Gingerbread version 2.3.5) 2. I first want to warn anyone without extensive knowledge to read about the processes of rooting and installing a custom ROM onto your specific device before attempting it. THIS WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY and if done incorrectly can \"Brick\" the device(turn it into an expensive paperweight LOL). This is partly why I didn't bring this all up earlier. I don't want to be responsible for someone messing up their phone. If you are still interested you will need to go to the site mentioned above and search for your device and see what is available in terms of custom ROMS & Kernels for the device in question, pretty much any question that you can think of will be answered in the forums. I am here to help if you or someone else is stuck on a specific part of the process but I do have a busy schedule so you will need to do the research. 3. To power most devices besides keyboards, mice or game controllers you will need to connect the devices to a powered usb hub and then connect the hub to the phone. Basically even though/if the phone/tablet can communicate with the device it cannot power them. I hope this comes across correctly. While I am here to help people must be willing to take time to learn. I do not know everything but am pretty good at figuring things out. I just use past experiences, deductive reasoning & google and youtube to fill in the gaps LOL hope I don't sound like a jerk :D. As I offered earlier if anyone needs help shoot me an email at drewbutler44 at gmail.com In order to help I need details for example: Device make and model and OS version. I can help with PC issues as well as Android issues just please be patient because I have a pretty hectic schedule.

Prices are usually cheaper online, and eBay is known for good deals, but there are some deals that should raise a red flag. Some scam sellers make new accounts to list very valuable items for enormous discounts. These items could be counterfeit, broken, or stolen, and the seller will describe them as new. Do more investigating if you see deals that seem too good to be true. [6] For example, you might see a seller offering a new iPhone for significantly cheaper than all the other iPhones on eBay. This is a red flag, and you should question why a seller could offer a new iPhone so far below the normal market price. It is an even bigger red flag if the account has few or no reviews. Very cheap items are not necessarily a negative thing. Someone may be moving soon and just has to get rid of items fast. But it is a reason to do more investigating. Image titled Find Reliable Sellers on eBay Step 7 2 Use caution if the item picture is a stock photo. eBay allows sellers to upload their own photos of the item they're selling. If they upload a stock photo from a website or the product manufacturer, this is a red flag because they may be trying to hide the actual condition of their item. If you see an item using a generic stock photo, look into the seller's feedback to ensure that they are reputable. [7] This is especially important for used and collectible items when the condition is very important. If you can't see the actual item for sale, there is a chance it's damaged or not in the condition that the user is describing. Image titled Find Reliable Sellers on eBay Step 8 3 Check if the seller has listed similar items on their profile. In a seller s feedback profile, scroll down to find the Items for Sale section. Click See all to get a list of all other items that this seller is listing. If a seller has a lot of items in the same category, it indicates that this seller has a specialty. This is a good sign. Sellers that specialize in one category are usually professionals and take selling very seriously. They will work hard to deliver your items and handle any issues that arise. [8] Having a lot of different items is, again, not necessarily a negative thing. People often use eBay to clean out their garages and homes, and naturally have many diverse items for sale. But this usually means they aren t professional sellers and might be less skilled or willing to deliver the best service possible. Having one high-value item for sale and nothing else is a bigger red flag. This could be a fake seller profile that someone is using to unload damaged products. Image titled Find Reliable Sellers on eBay Step 9 4 Ask the seller a question about the item if you re suspicious. If you have any uncertainties about a product or a seller, contact them through eBay. Click the Ask a Question option on the product page to contact the seller. Request more information about the product or its price if you have any doubts. If the seller delays or dodges your question, avoid this item. [9] See how fast and completely the seller answers your question. A good guideline is that reputable sellers respond within 24 hours, or 48 hours if you contacted them on a weekend or holiday. A seller with slow communication may be less reliable. Image titled Find Reliable Sellers on eBay Step 10 5 Avoid completing transactions outside of eBay. If a seller asks you to leave eBay and buy their item from another site, or contact them directly off of eBay s communication channel, do not buy the item. Once you leave eBay, you re no longer covered by their money-back guarantee. Scam sellers try to get people away from the main site so buyers won t be able to get their money back. Never listen to a seller who tells you to do this. [10] Asking buyers to complete transactions off of eBay is a violation of the site s policy. If a seller asks you to do this, report them to eBay.

Only you will get any replies Hope this helps and thanks for commenting. =-) Reply Baba on September 21, 2016 Hi Carol: My situation is a bit different. I have an android smart phone. At this moment, all that I need is to send a text message to one person, and the same text message to be sent at the same time to a second party as an email. At this time, the message is to be sent to just two parties (one party receives it as a text message, and the second party receives it as an email). Purpose: for your worship house, I need to send a text message one member, but I need to copy the treasurer the same message as an email. Please advise M-USA Reply Judy on September 22, 2016 Hi Baba, I don t think that s possible. Anon on September 28, 2016 You could probably do it with Tasker, but you d basically have to build the app yourself. One text input field and a send button that initiates two actions: one sending the text from the input field to a specific number, the second sending the text from the input field as the body of an email to a specific address. I d add some extra functions too: write the text field to a file every N seconds, as a backup and to be loaded automatically on scene open; this file could be cleared on successful sending. A button/automatic saving to a local text file as well. Autofill the email subject line, say Automatic copy of txt to to treasurer, . Etc etc. Depending on your skill level and how polished the end result needs to be it could take from a few hours to a few days (even months) to create.

Reply Dani on January 30, 2015 Nicole, I don t have a phone on Virgin mobile, so I can t test it out myself, but after a little research here are a few potential solutions: go to settings. go to more settings. go to mobile networks. click on network mode. select cdma. it will reboot your phone. and it should allow you to send messages. Unfortunately cdma mode only works through 3g, so you have to sacrifice with this method. Another possible solution: Settings>General>MMS Size Limit. Change the limit size to 1M if it s not already there. Reboot the app and see if it works. If these don t work, look through the settings and try to find some MMS settings that might be causing the problem. Try writing up a bug report to Go SMS Pro to see if they can help you out. Reply Carolyn on September 23, 2019 I am having the opposite problem with my Android. My group texts don t show other contacts, so when I respond to one contact, everyone gets it, but no one knows why they are getting the message because they don t know they are on a group text. This is so annoying. Reply Daniel on September 25, 2019 Hi Carolyn, that s the issue with replying to a group text. It s best to create a new message with that specific contact than replying to the group message. Otherwise, everyone who s included in the group message will receive it. Reply Sandra on February 26, 2015 Many android phones have a limit on the number of people you can text simultaneously. My current Samsung Note 2 has a limit of 10; a Sony Experia Z3 I m considering buying has a limit of 50. The explanation here about how to create a Group for your contacts to enable group texting (sometimes called mass texting or multi texting) doen t explain that many android phones have an inbuilt limitation on the number of people you can multitext in the software. I have looked at Go SMS Pro; but users Feedback comments are scathing about the most recent upgrade. I have also considered Handcent; but similarly, users are incredibly dissatisfied with the most recent update. Both sites have comments about their most recent App updates that would make it impossible for me to use their App for my multitexts. (I arrange wildlife rescues and need to text 100 people simultaneously. My current Samsung phone has a limit of 10 people per multitext; so I have to send the text 10 times; which is time consuming and frustrating.0 I don t need to group chat; in fact it would be counter-productive. I haven t looked into GroupMe yet; but will. Any suggestions in the meantime? Thanks Reply Dani on March 10, 2015 Sandra, Have you tried this app?

But I delete conversations on a daily basis. Once I delete the group MMS conversation I don t get any new replies from any other iPhone recipients, if there are any. Furthermore, if I create a new group MMS with the same recipients, say a week later, I still don t get replies from iPhones. It s not until all group participants delete that group MMS thread, then I get iPhone replies. It s frustrating. I guess the moral of THIS story is: don t delete the group MMS threads!

If one of them goes into the group thread and then try to send a picture, they claim it never sends. Is this a typical problem with GroupMe, or could it be something else (perhaps my settings?

Reply nancy on June 6, 2015 Is it true -if you switched to an android from iPhone. Your friends recognize your number as an iPhone user and responds with a iPhone messaget that you don t get. I went to iTunes and dissociated my number with apple. I hear ithe takes awhile before your number is forgotten as an iPhone then your friends I phones will see you as an android and send correctmy formatted messages Reply JOA Team Sam on June 6, 2015 Hi Nancy, This was the case few months back. It drew a lot of press news mentioning that Apple intentionally locks down the users to their iMessage so that competing platforms like Android users suffer. However the good news is Apple responded and provided a way around for this. If you still use your iPhone you can go to Settings > Messages > iMessage > OFF. If you have already switched to Android you can use this page from Apple website to deregister yourself. Hope this helps.

The text is sent from a Galaxy S6 on Verizon network. I recently got the new phone in the past month. Prior to this I was using a Galaxy S3 and having no issues other than having to forward or resend the same text message out 4 times from the stock texting program. Since I have begun using the new phone I am still limited to sending the message to 20 people at once, but now the entire text is not being received by everyone. Some receive the entire message but some receive only a cut off version. Maybe some are receiving the message as an mms and some as an sms? So two questions would be how do I get the entire text message to go through to all recipients and a plus would be if I could send only one text message to everyone in my men s group text.

If you want to include others in the conversation or remove people from it, you can just go to the existing group and add or remove contacts. Let me know if you have any more questions. Reply Rita on July 13, 2017 My in-laws have iPhones and they have tried to add my number to the family group text but their phones won t let them. Any solutions without having to resort to getting an iPhone? Reply megan on July 18, 2017 Any of these apps would be a great solution, Rita! Reply Lauren on December 7, 2017 But do your iPhone friends HAVE to get on those messaging apps as well? Like you ve got to get everyone on the app correct? Reply megan on December 14, 2017 Hi, Lauren! Actually, no, your iPhone using friends can continue to use their messaging app of choice. Reply Keith on August 25, 2017 When I try to add a group in Android contacts, it gives me the choice of creating it either under Backup Assistant Plus or Google. Google didn t work, so I created it under BAP. And it shows that the group exists. But when I try to find the group in my contacts to send out a text, it is not in my contact list. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Reply megan on August 29, 2017 Hi, Keith. Is Backup Assistant Plus an app that you downloaded? If so, you may not be able to access the group you created except within the app. You may also need to make sure that BAP has the necessary permissions enabled to make a group and for you to access it. Could you expand on what happened when you tried to create a group using Google? Reply Debbie on August 11, 2018 I have a Samsung J7 and my family all have I phones. Afyer a recent update they nowonly receive one third to a half of my text messages. Any ideas on how to fix this? The AT&T rep told me it was because iphone didn t play well with Androids and uses I-messaging. The only suggestion was to buy an i-phone. Reply here on November 1, 2018 Hmm it appears like your website ate my first comment (it was super long) so I guess I ll just sum it up what I had written and say, I m thoroughly enjoying your blog.

Reply Drew on November 13, 2018 Why does everyone always comment and say I m having the exact same issue as you are! My phone is doing the exact same thing as your s is! What s the damn point in writing that? If you don t have a solution or a fix for the problem then why are you even writing anything at all? There should only be one message saying what the problem is and then a whole bunch of answers or opinions or ideas or solutions. There are literally 30 replys and all of them say I m having the same problem.. Same problem here.. My phone is doing that too.. Me too.. I have the same phone as you and mine is doing that too.. I just don t get it at all and it s not just on this site, it s literally every single forum on the entire internet! It s so irritating. I have to scroll through like 30 of the exact same comments just to get to someone who s posted something that may help my issue or someone who is actually talking about what actually might be causing the problem. STOP ALREADY! PLEASE! Reply android application on December 14, 2018 A lot of people still prefer text messages as the best way to keep in touch with others. Well, they are quick and reliable. You can be almost sure that the message will reach the recipient. Reply Clement Essien on December 22, 2018 Great Post, will like to link it.

Reply David Cook on June 13, 2019 If I send out an MMS group text from my Android phone, one of the people I list in the group does not receive the text. She has an iPhone X. What messaging setting on her phone is most likely the one blocking her receipt of my group texts? Other iPhones in the group are receiving the texts. Reply Kate on August 30, 2019 I just got added to a group text, the author created from her android and everyone seems to be receiving the text. There is one number listed under the group name and everyone is freaking because they think its a phone number (scam) and I think the group has some kind of ID number. How can I check that out. I did google the # and it did not come up as a valid mobile phone . Reply Daniel on August 30, 2019 Hi Kate, Googling a phone number will not be helpful at all. Even if it s a valid number, if it s not registered to any company or person online, then it will appear as an invalid number. What you can do is block the number to stop receiving and prevent the group from sending anymore text messages to it. Reply Donald on September 30, 2019 How can I see previous messages from a group text that is no longer available? Reply Daniel on October 1, 2019 Hi Donald, unfortunately, you can t view previous messages anymore from a group text if it s no longer available. You may need to view them using the phones by individuals who s included in the group. Otherwise, you may have to use other means such as recovering deleted text messages.

It validated that I have the correct settings (Group texting MMS enabled). I have a OnePlus and use the Messages app from Google. My success in sending and receiving group texts is spotty at best. Frequently, photos will not download. Sometimes text responses will not download, and occassional my responses will not upload to the group text. I get a perpertual Sending status under the message to be sent. What is going on? How can I get group texting to function correctly? Any guidance would be most appreciated!

Number 5 did the work for me. I tried so many things before but nothing was working. Reply MaryJean November 22, 2019 at 1:37 pm Ok, so I guess I am the only one who has run into this problem bc I can't find anything on the internet/youtube to address this. While taking a road trip my Nextbook Ares 11.6 tablet got plugged into the wrong cord. The cord it got plugged into was for my portable oxygen machine that is a much stronger output. Now the tablet won't boot up. I spoke to a programer friend and he suggested I remove the battery and allow it to drain but due to the copper tape on the back the best I could do was disconnect it. Has anyone removed a battery for one of these? Do you know where I could purchase the copper tape? I have another battery from a parts tablet just held up by the copper copper tape panel on the back side. I would welcome some fresh ideas as I have a lot of stuff on this tablet I would like to save. Reply noname November 17, 2019 at 5:22 pm What should I do if my phone charges but it wont just turn on?

Reply Siju December 14, 2014 at 4:11 pm following experiment is not be repeated(unless... ) i had tegra note 7 (nvidia/xolo). i wasn't using the tablet for few days(probably got switched off because of the low charge ). When i put it on charging, there was no charging animation. After an hour in trying switching it on, nothing happened. Then I started searching internet and came across this site. The battery of tegra note is non removable and soldered directly on to mother board unlike nexus 7(1st gen), so removing battery was out of question. Then i tried pressing the power as recommended, nothing happened. neither did the recovery mode . So i opened the back panel and checked the battery voltage with multimeter, it showed 3.17V. Connected the usb charger and checked (with charger connected) , it showed the same voltage again. I then connected the tegra note battery with an external power supply(4.9V, 2A.. directly) and boosted the voltage till 3.3V.... connected the usb cable... charging animation is back... and device booted after 5 min .. Happy ending :-) Reply daniel December 10, 2014 at 10:02 am So first my samsung tab 3 wont open even if i press the power button for an hour then i tried to take it off but guess what.....,there is no way you cant take it out even with screws ok srsly samsung atleast put screws so we can open it to check and i put it in the chsrger for 24 hours 1 day and still doesnt open i dont want to buy an iphone you can just call text and play games you cant do anything not even custimize your own phone!

Reply Sharon H January 16, 2014 at 2:42 pm I agree with Tom E. My Samsung was doing the samething and I opened it up and under the inner power button was one piece of cat hair. Blowing that out did the trick. Until I did this I had to plug it into the charger to get it to turn on which only works if you're near the charger when your phone rings.

Reply Tom E January 16, 2014 at 12:46 pm My last phone had a power button that pushed, but did nothing. I opened the phone up, and the power button was moved, due to dust and pocket lint. A little cleaning and it worked! Getting the phone open (Samsung Galaxy S 2) was not trivial, but just look for instructions -- someone else HAS to have opened one up and posted instructions online.

Very helpful to know that is possible to use ibooks to listen to audiobooks! Anyway, a limitation I noticed with using ibooks for audibooks is that although automatically saves the latest place in the book I had listened, it inot possible using ibooks to save multiple bookmarks of the same book that one can save when is listening to one audiobook and likes to get back to specific places or segments of that book (for instance to listen it again or write a quote one likes). Basically, i'm looking for the feature that ibooks have for books, but I see is missing for audiobooks. Does Bound has this feature that enables to save several bookmarks of the same book one is listening to? Reply Annette January 28, 2019 at 3:10 pm Seriously!!??? Where has this info been all my life? I've been listening to audiobooks in iTunes and having to scrubber my way back to the place I left off for....YEARS!!!! I hated stopping a book and I would leave it open on my ipod so I wouldn't lose my place. I knew there must be a better way or an app of some kind and that's when I landed here. THANKS THANKS THANKS. Reply Listening September 13, 2018 at 5:54 am OMG, Thank YOU! I love Hay House audiobooks, but they only have a super basic player on their website. They do allow downloads of purchased material, but I couldn't get iTunes to work (I do almost all of my computing on my phone and don't sync it to my laptop so didn't want to have to start now). Bookmobile is working perfectly so far. Sure I have to use the laptop to get the book onto my phone, but I don't have to deal with all the hassle of iOS trying to sync everything just to be able to listen to a book. I've been listening to the book in Files and trying to remember where I left off each time... Ugh. Thank you! Reply JB July 9, 2018 at 4:30 am Hi: I am looking for an alternative to ibooks. All the apps I've tried so far don't access the audiobooks (mp3) files that I load using 3rd party software. ibooks finds the files for playing OK, but sometimes looses my place after ending & restarting the app. Not always, just sometimes then making it a hassle to find where I left off. Any suggestions will be appreciated. JB Reply James December 2, 2017 at 5:10 pm I used iBooks for a long time, but keeping all the metadata correct and making sure iBooks was happy was too much of a pain. So I got Bookmobile and was a big fan of that for a while. But loading up books was still a pain. Zipping up a directory of mp3s made things easier to transfer but it was still just too many steps for me. I just recently got Bound and love that is (just recently got the feature) connects to my OneDrive account. The only thing I wish it would do it start in a directory of my choosing and sync location across devices. But it is SO much easier to load books now. Reply Kenny September 23, 2017 at 12:46 pm To get the default music player to remember or bookmark your place, you must perform the following steps. 1. Use MediaMonkey or some tool to make sure all of the metadata is the same for all of the tracks. Otherwise, iTunes may not know they need to stay together. 2. Drag the files into iTunes, go to Music to find them, select them all, right click and select Get Info and mark that the files are a Compilation (checkbox). 3. Go to options in iTunes and select to Remember Playback Position and CLICK OK (do not select the media kind to audiobook until after clicking OK - next step). 4. With files selected, right click and select Get Info again, go to OPTIONS and change the media kind to AUDIOBOOK. Now, you can use the built-in player if you like. What I have found over the years is that Apple will eventually make every audiobook application you love not work with some software update, so you might as well use theirs. Reply Jan August 17, 2017 at 7:29 am How do you access other Libraries Overdrive audiobooks if you don't have a library card for that library? I use the Overdrive app for my library and my daughter shares her library card with me for hers. But I don't know how to say access a library in Ohio if I'm in Maryland. Would really appreciate any help I can get. My library will get trilogies where book 1 and 3 are audiobooks but book 2 will be an ebook so I can end up buying it.

For me Windows in whatever flavor is everywhere thanks to savvy marketing and some very aggressive sales strategies. I'm a bit geeky so I use Linux at home simply because (besides games) it's a thousand percent more versatile. With regards to the 90% market share comments I would say it's hard to measure the market share of something that's free but most of you will already know that the fastest research machines in the world run some kind of Linux distro more often than not. I think the truth is if you aren't particularly computer savvy then Windows is great. It has virtually no learning curve and even a monkey can use it. If you want a fully customizable OS that's free and can be made as simple or as complicated as possible then Linux distro's have to be your bag baby. My partner uses windows almost exclusively knows nothing about computers but can jump on my Linux machine and do what she needs just as easily as she can in Windows. My conclusion would be if you want an idiot proof box (and most of us do) then Windows is for you. If computers are of interest to you and you want to push out all the boundaries you can't beat Linux. Reply Anonymous September 20, 2015 at 2:46 pm If someone jumped (literally) on your machine, it'd be smashed to smithereens. Reply Rupert Taylor September 5, 2014 at 5:11 pm I do not like either of the options presented here, instead through my investigations, have found LinuxMint 17 Cinammon Edition to provide a beautiful desktop experience which allows me to create, explore and archive all my work equally if not better than the options presented here. What is the #1 exploited operating system and most at risk for probable compromise? Windows is. If you really care about your privacy and security, Windows is the last operating system you would want. But I guess it's hard to leave the slums when all your friends are there too, huh?!!

Reply Masimus August 17, 2014 at 9:46 pm I have used windows from windows 95 until 8.1, it evolved and it is a good OS with many aplications, and very good for gamers, multimedia and browsing, But so has become linux lately and Doesn't cost a penny! However as many say, when using Metro on \"not touch displays\" ... it is more dificult! Navigating windows has become more difficult due to Metro! Metro is for touch and not for \"Mouse users\"! I personaly like my desktop with big and multy display's so when i passed from Win 7 to 8 was a bad experience! Linux was hard to settup in early versions, but recently it is \"out of box\", some little adjustments here and there, diferent from sistems(bumblebee for Nvidia Optimus for example)! But isn't a pain in windows when the message of error apear that your driver is not compatible with a game and the new one is bugy for the one that worked flawlesly before???!!! I personaly dont like Unity, so i use KDE or Cinnamon(those i like most). Personalizing the workspace, linux is a pro! Stability and almost no crashes go for linux, sory windows lovers, windows crush alott for me when i have most fun in games and i have to be carefully to save my work every 5 minutes not to lose hours of work because of the bugy OS! Conections stability and speed again goes for linux, windows disconect always and the speed is better in browsing or downloading in linux! Linux has same speed always even after an year or more of use, windows goes slowly every day and after 6 months for me it is at 50% from when i started using it! When talking about programing i like linux more for it's stability and even speed of manouvering the datta in many cases! Viruses and trojans, backdoors ... here i guess windows has more because it is more \"popular\"(microsoft must have some aranjements with the PC producers or just with the maketing managers) ... let's not judje, business is business. Speaking of it, making your desktop from parts and using linux gave you the possibility to buy better hardware with the monney you would normaly have to pay for OS, sorry windows , Linux is still FREE! In the end i like more Linux, lately has no problems with graphic incompatibility as before, many windows programs even work on linux more and more(thanx to Wine and other same programs). Lately i use windows Only For Games! When there will be no problem for those to work well on linux, i will pass completely to linux! This is my opinion and every one can use wethever they like and do werever they want! Sorry for my bad english, as you can guess i am not a \"native english\"! Reply hotshot1 August 9, 2014 at 6:38 pm Just my 2 cents worth for anyone that wants to try linux: I recommend that you make an image of your drive in case you do not like Ubuntu or want to try other versions of Linux. Restoring your drive from an image file is much faster than doing a complete install from scratch. You can burn a DVD or create a bootable flash drive to run or install linux. (You can make a bootable flash drive with several different small standalone programs. You run the program and point it to the iso image. I like using my desktop because the files are easy to find) NOTE: You can run the live dvd or bootable flash drive without installing linux. I first let Ubuntu install as a dual boot system alongside of Windows. Later I took the plunge and did a FULL install of Ubuntu. I actually did the install at a coffee shop on the wifi. It was a flawless install. Ubuntu also downloaded all available updates during the install. My laptop is an older 2Ghz Dual Core machine (It's fast enough for anything I wish to do) Reply Billybob T August 9, 2014 at 6:00 pm Let's face facts. Both interfaces really suck. I have to use Windows at work and feel extremely fortunate that the government is still stuck on Windows 7. At home, Linux Mint Cinnamon is my flavor of choice, simply because Unity is the most difficult thing to navigate for someone that got used to Linux with a Gnome desktop. Reply Paul August 9, 2014 at 11:16 pm \"Unity is the most difficult thing to navigate for someone that got used to Linux with a Gnome desktop.\" And doesn't want to spend an hour learning Unity or lacks any ability to adapt. One day you may have to.You won't always have out of date tech to fall back on. Reply Bruce Barnes August 8, 2014 at 8:11 pm I think this article was somewhat biased towards Windows and I've used Microsoft since DOS 5. Here are what I consider to be major advantages for Ubuntu: 1. The Software Center makes it super-easy to find and install apps. 2. System and app updates all covered in one update app. 3. No real need for anti-virus software and the weekly scans. 4. Doesn't slow down over time. 5. It's FREE and easy to install and it's even compatible with Win. in that it can read its partitions and Wine can run a lot of Windows programs. Reply dragonmout August 8, 2014 at 9:08 pm And when a user installs Ubuntu, as well as all popular Linux distros, all applications that an average user might need are installed for FREE. No need to purchas an Office suite, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, etc. Reply Ehab August 8, 2014 at 4:33 am I have been using Windows ever since I was introduced to a computer. Last school year, however, I had to use a Mac for a full semester. I did not like Mac at all. It was slow, and felt like you had to be really familiar with it in order to navigate it sufficiently. Around the same time, it was announced that Windows XP was not going to be supported anymore. On its last day of support I switched to Ubuntu. It was a huge improvement! I did not think my computer could be so fast. Its booting time improved a lot, and was super easy to use. And that reaction was from ~10 days of usage, as opposed to the full semester of Mac usage. Keep in mind that I have never used both of these systems before. Right now, I have a windows 8.1 Laptop along with my Ubuntu computer, and even though I feel that they are both equal, I think that Linux is much better. Reply Bobbie Sellers August 8, 2014 at 1:43 am Hah! Both suck majorly for me. KDE is the way to go and specifically the KDE using distribution using the old Mandriva style Computer Central Control usually called by mcc in terminal or menu with root requester. The 'buntus hate root and use sudo to try to get around that hatred but the setting are widely distributed in Canonical so that the program you need to correct a setting may be unknown to the users. Lubuntu is the best of the main 'buntus. I am using Mageia 4.1 now after a tussle with Kubuntu which ended in a loss of information. KDE though lets you have multiple virtual desktops or only one which was the setup I used on a 15 year old Dell Inspiron 4000 with 8 megabytes of video ram. I went to the one desktop because it was an old XP and I figured it could not handle a heavy graphics load. KDE has similar control of Virual Desktops thru a pager on a task bar with the icons named or numbered. You can start programs as mentioned from a virtual terminal or a menu bar. You can have up to 4 task bars which you can learn to move around as you please. Currently I have two vertical invisible bars which only show the icons and other widgets floating to either side of my screen. But the read reason that KDE is great is its programs like Dolphin the file manager which can have multiple panes and tabs. Kate the advanced text editor suitable for programming or other work. I could go on ranting but I am old and ready for supper. Reply Dale M August 8, 2014 at 12:13 pm Sudo use is to keep your system secure. DON'T use root directly to keep your system secure. With sudo you issue the root command then root goes to \"sleep\". Any other way of administering your system and your asking for trouble. Reply dragonmout August 8, 2014 at 9:01 pm \"Sudo use is to keep your system secure. \" Yeah, real secure. If somebody cracks your user password, they have access to root functions through \"sudo\". Considering that many *buntu users set up an autologin because they can't be bothered to type in a password, cracking the password is not even necessary. Anybody walking by has immediate access to root through \"sudo.\" *buntu's \"sudo\"setup is pseudo secure. OTOH, if a distro has a real root userid with its own password, a hacker has to crack two passwords. Even with user autologin, a root password still has to be supplied to access root function. Reply Max August 8, 2014 at 12:24 am Suddenly (after test another HD) my computer no longer accepts the grubii have to use F12 and select the drive manually to my MB GA-H81m-h, identify the Lubuntu. Gigabyte said they do not support linux! Reply Mary Brady August 7, 2014 at 10:08 pm I like the fact that Ubuntu is free. Anyone with a modicum of computer knowledge can set up and use Linux. Thus far, I have installed a Linux distribution on an old 40 GB hard drive computer which previously had Windows XP. On my laptop w/ Windows 7, I have dual booted Ubuntu 14.4 Am now taking the edX free course to learn how to use the Linux command line and graphic interface. The only caveat to a great experience w/ Linux is that some certain printers and scanners do not have drivers compatible w/ Linux. (Although this also occurs w/ older hardware's drivers and Windows). Am a 60-something Granny, so anyone can do Linux. Reply Dale M August 8, 2014 at 12:09 pm I like to hear this. As they say \"Even an old dog can learn new tricks\". Agreed on the older hardware drivers issue. Reply Robert B August 8, 2014 at 2:04 pm Mary, If you have a printer that you cannot find a driver for when using Linux there is a possible solution, if you have a Brother, Canon, Epson or HP printer there is a company called ZEDOnet that started out many years ago writing printer drivers for the Commodore Amiga and since around 2000 or so for Linux. http://www.turboprint.info/ Their program called TurboPrint 2 has many printers that it supports and if your model is listed you can use a trial ware version to see if it will work before you purchase the program that currently costs $40 USD. I still use it because they have a driver for my fairly new Canon Pixma Pro 100 printer, and it is better than the windows driver that Canon provides. They have been working on a Windows version that is called PrintFab Windows that is currently under a free Beta test. I have both this driver and the official Canon driver installed and have found the color reproduction to be far more accurate with the PrintFab for Windows driver. They even have a color matching service that I think costs around $20.00 that you can use to receive a custom color profile for use with your printer. You print out a special test page that they send you when you purchase the service on there store, print it out on the paper that you normally use with your printer and mail it to them. They measure the colors that are printed and if they vary from their known values they generate a custom profile that is emailed to you that you add to your TurboPrint or PrintFab Windows to get you the most accurate results. They only deal with printers so if you have an all in one they will most likely have the driver but you are on your own with respect to getting your scanner working. Reply Robert B August 8, 2014 at 2:08 pm Oh I also forgot to mention that if you have an older printer that is no longer supported by say Epson with newer drivers PrintFab Windows may have one that will work. I had an older Epson 1220 wide carriage printer that Epson stopped providing drivers for at Windows XP and this driver is on the list Reply techno August 8, 2014 at 3:20 pm This is the exact experience I think most people would have and I am glad it worked for you. Computer novices running anything Ubuntu based are probably not going to have a terribly hard time using it. Most everything has been thought out. I personally would recommend something like Zorin, Kubuntu, or Mint as an entry point so that the experience is as familiar and non-frightening as possible. I really think that the software centers of the different distributions are their main selling points. Reply WEC August 7, 2014 at 9:07 pm Modern UI is not for me, I installed ClassicShell to feel W8.1 comfortable for my needs. Unity brings the OS X like desktop to Linux, which is great and I like Ubuntu. It runs quick (14.04.1 - x64) on my old laptop purchased in 2007. Let's compare the software update process. - On Windows, all application has its own updater and runs in the background taking up resources. If you have MS Office 2013 installed, you will likely download 1~1.5 GB on every update Tuesday. - In Linux, there's only one updater which updates all your installed app. This approach is looking better to me. Reply Karan August 7, 2014 at 5:56 pm If you are a computer enthusiast, check both OS else choose Windows. Linux apps are free but there are lots of other applications which are better, stable and free (for Windows Operating system). Reply Robert B August 7, 2014 at 5:56 pm I hate both of them and would not use either of them if they paid me to use them! For me my last windozzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz I will ever use is widows 7, as for Linux the desktops I will never use are Unity at the top of the list and then closely followed by Gnome 3. For now I use KDE, I am puzzled as to why you make it seem that Ubuntu is the only choice for Linux, it too is the last distro I would ever run! There are many that are far better than Ubuntu, with their too quick release schedule, I think it is now every 6 months. You the end user are doomed to always be running Alpha grade software and at the very best an early Beta release. For a very new Linux user I suggest using Mint Linux, preferably the one based on Debian, there are other very promising distros geared to the new Linux user however I am the most familar with Mint Linux. I quite frankly do not understand how and why Ubuntu is rated as the most popular, perhaps it is because of articles like this one which makes it seem that it is the only one that you should use and most Windows people are either too inexperienced to explore and are so used to not having a choice, especially when it comes to the UI that is presented by an OS. Perhaps instead of this type of article you could spark interest in exploration when it comes to Linux and show just how easy it is to install and to use many different desktops all from a base install of Linux say Mint Linux or Debian or Sabayon Linux. I currently have E17 or is it currently E18, KDE, LXDE, Fluxbox, and a custom desktop based on the Openbox window manager that I am working on. You might want to explain to the many new Linux users just what makes up a desktop environment and that if we are willing to put in a little effort that we do not have to be satisfied with any of the canned Desktops and by selecting our favorite window manager and other various utilities for example, ones that draw icons on the desktop, wifi and bluetooth configuration, multimedia apps (VLC is a good choice even on Windows), clipboard utilities etc. By learning of all the various different elements and using many of them you quickly find that there are many that work far better than the ones provided in a pre canned desktops like Gnome, Kde and Unity for example and when you are all done you will have a desktop environment that is uniquely yours and usually far less demanding on system resources than the other environments currently on offer. Reply Dale M August 8, 2014 at 12:06 pm Robert B, you do realize that Mint is a Ubuntu variant? I will agree that Unity and Gnome3 suck. I prefer LXDE or Gnome2 (Classic). Reply Robert B August 8, 2014 at 1:38 pm Yes I am aware that some of their offerings are based on Ubuntu, however I recommended that you use the Debian based Mint not the regular Mint. One of the things I also do not like about Ubuntu is that their search engine phones home (back to Canacol sp?) everything that you search for, even if it is only when you are looking for something that is on your local system. And they share it with Google so Google can send the end user targeted ads and send money to Canacol. Ubuntu used to be based on Debian, how ever a few years ago they began suffering from the need to reinvent the wheel and diverged from the base Debian so it is a hit or miss proposition that a .deb file made for Ubuntu will probably not work with Debian and vice versa. I feel strongly that they should not have the right to use the .deb extension on their packages. Reply Matthew August 7, 2014 at 5:20 pm Modern/Metro versus Unity? One thing they share, is that they are both an acquired taste.. Ubuntu's move to Unity was not popular, but then Linux gives you the freedom to choose one of many that suit you better. If Microsoft had listened to users wanting the traditional start menu on their desktop, Windows 8 would have gained momentum as a desktop upgrade Reply Troy Laquerre August 7, 2014 at 5:07 pm Well Ben that is contingent on if you already have the file downloaded and the software to unpack it. I'm saying is Linux will go and find, download, install, and update, all from command line with just two commands. Reply Troy Laquerre August 7, 2014 at 4:34 pm Steps for installing software on Windows 8 vs Ubuntu. Windows 8: 1. Find a download link somewhere on the net and hope it just the software and not just a bunch of spyware. 2: Find the DL on your drive and update Antivirus before you scan sated download. 3: If program is not in a .EXE format locate and install/update whatever archive manager its packed in. 4: Now you can install it! 5: Update program 5: Send install file to the recycle bin and then dont forget to empty it. Ubuntu 1. Open console and type \"sudo apt-get install (name of program) 2. Type \"sudo apt-get update\" Your done =) No desktop needed I was a loyal windows user from the days of Windows 3.1 until i made the switch. Im never going back. Reply BEN August 7, 2014 at 4:41 pm wrong. I can install an exe windows program in just two steps file explorer press file and install pop up yes or no press yes and installed package and installed successfully where as crappy unbuntu does not, gives too many packages becomes an invalid file and it refuses to install, what a crappy os. so your point is flawed Reply Rusty Raptor August 9, 2014 at 11:43 am actually you can just open the software center or synaptic package manager and find the program. This beats windows because all the software in the repo is safe and you can trust it. where as donloading from the web like that is dangerous, Reply Uvarias Ur August 7, 2014 at 4:16 pm There is a MAJOR difference between Windows and ANY distribution of Linux. Windows gives the user ONLY 1 UI. Any LInux distribution allows the user to choose from several UI. These UIs currently consist of: Gnome, Gnome Classic, Gnome flashback (Compiz), Gnome flashback (Metacity), KDE Plasma 4 KDE Plasma 5 , and Unity (on Ubuntu). So on Windows there is ONLY 1 possibility, whereas on LInux there are 6 (or 7 on Ubuntu). That being said, referring to the Windows UI as 'Modern' is an obvious bias. Unity and Gnome (and I suspect KDE as well) are designed to work on ordinary CRTs, flat screens (of all aspect ratios), and touch screens. Can the Windows UI do all that? Reply Ja V August 8, 2014 at 12:53 am You forgot my favorite, Cinnamon. And I like Enlightenment too. Although on an old machine, LXDE flies like XP did (without the malware), and MATE is light too. Unity? seriously?? That's the worst Linux desktop for some people, although some like it. Thing is, Windows gives you little choice. Reply James August 7, 2014 at 3:37 pm I am steering clients that had XP to Zorin - very similar look to what they are used to. Reply John August 7, 2014 at 2:34 pm Windows 8 is awful. It simply continues the tradition of Microsoft releasing alternating good and terrible versions of Windows. Hopefully, Windows 9 will continue the cycle and be really good. I'll grant that there are improvements under the hood, but the UI is obnoxious, at best, unless one spends all one's time in the desktop, as I do. Given that, there's no reason to have moved off of Windows 7. The attempt to make a UI that works on every type of device is a dismal failure. The best that can be said is that it sucks less on some devices than others. There's a reason why Windows 7 is still available on new PCs and why Windows phones and tablets are barely a blip on the mobile device radar. Reply Antonio N August 7, 2014 at 2:23 pm Here are my thoughts. I like Windows 8. It does everything that you could ask for in a computer OS. I also want to tell people that having a Windows 8 computer and changing it to look like Windows 7 is not a good idea. I think that the earlier that they accustomed to the new interface the better off they will be. Windows 7 will last a few years yet, but I think it's going to be important for people to bite the bullet, learn the differences (Which aren't many) and go ahead with Windows 8. I'm hoping that Microsoft can keep the cost down, but only time will tell. Just my 2 cents. Reply Vincent August 7, 2014 at 12:00 pm There is an error in the article. It tries to point out that internet searching on Ubuntu is easier and returns more results than in Windows 8. The author might not be aware of the Search Hero function in Windows 8.1, which only appears when you hit Enter on a charms bar search. This is tightly integrated with Bing and can be done from the Start screen just by immediately typing. http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/windows-8-search-hero.jpg Reply Vincent August 7, 2014 at 11:56 am <<>> I am so tired of hearing people complain about the changes made to Windows 8. Has it ever occurred to you that you might be just a teensy bit unjustified in judging Windows 8 so quickly just because it's different? I think the quick judgement of people against Windows 8 is due to it being unfamiliar. It's just that you're scared, because there's something new that you don't understand. You don't like change, because you've been seeing things change so quickly for the past 25 years and you're just tired of it all. Give it a chance, and if you really don't like it, don't just assume that the changes are all bad. Changes are good, and in the case of Windows 8, they are for the most part. I would personally have Microsoft scrap the desktop and the old windowing system. The new windowing system that is used by Windows Store/Metro Apps is better: 1) No overlaps. Overlapping windows do not make sense. Metro apps can be viewed side by side (albeit on smaller screens it is limited to two, which should really be fixed). Metro apps in this \"windows\" that automatically adjust size are much more powerful compared to the old desktop windowing system of overlapping windows that you have to resize manually and waste space and hide content below them. 2) The Start Screen is good. I don't know why people hate it. It's just a full-screen start menu. Just ask yourself: what's so great about a little windowed menu pop-up? Nothing. But it's familiar. The Start Screen is so much better. It shows a greater number of apps, is more customizable, and although the horizontal orientation thing is weird, is by far easier to navigate. Your apps are listed from left to right. No stupid popup menus and hidden lists. 3) Tiles are better than icons. They're basically widgets. Okay, so they're too big. But get the update and you can make them smaller. And leave in a few larger ones to show you live updates that are really helpful. I am hoping tiles will gain more interactivity in future, becoming more like widgets, but so far, so good. 4) The charms bar is great. It's contextual and it's always there. It's much like the bar on top of Ubuntu ( I don't know what they call it) and its options change with the app. There are improvements that have to be made, like showing more clearly which app the charms are showing options for; or making it easier for keyboard and mouse users to access the charms bar; and adding more charms! But the separation of UI for in-app functionality and functionality bridging the app and the system is a logical and ultimately helpful choice. And those are just the UI side. There are tons more improvements--not just changes, but I would argue, improvements--in Windows 8.x. And until this day, Ubuntu still cannot beat the software selection, user-friendliness (and when I say user, I mean normal people who have never seen a command line interface and never want to; at least, not to install everyday software), and service-integration built into Windows. Reply techno August 7, 2014 at 3:43 pm Interesting that you think linux users would be afraid of GUI change since there are myriad desktops people use in linux. We already more choices than Windows. It's not that we're afraid of it, we just don't like it. Most users apparently feel the same way. From a sysadmin perspective it's a nightmare, it's actually harder to administer and takes more clicks to get done what you were able to get done with less. The start screen is actually really significantly harder to use for non-touch users with lots of applications. Having to scroll through hundreds of applications to get to one, where a nested folder structure in a start menu made it far easier, is not a selling point to someone like me. The tiles like functionality has been available in widgets on every major operating system for a very long time. Applications such as conky or rainmeter, plasma and even windows desktop widgets provided that functionality before killing the product off due to lack of interest. Think about that, Microsoft themselves admitted people didn't use them willingly. It really sounds like you haven't used linux in a very long time and are afraid of it. I literally just did an install of Kubuntu, a variant of Ubuntu with a more standard desktop, without a single terminal command, all point and click. They even have a software center that brings the software to you. On top of that, you can run a very large amount of windows software on linux pretty easily, either directly through WINE or through an application called playonlinux which has a large number of games and applications already prebuilt, including Office, Photoshop, Acrobat, and Hearthstone. Is it the exact same number of supported applications? No, there are often some gaps if you're totally bought into MS or Apple ecosystems, but I don't think most casual users are there. I personally loathe the charms bar, I find it unnecessary and and a terrible interface with not enough context clues. Plainly, it doesn't fit into my already established workflow. Windows 8 has been out for years now and the adoption rate has been terrible, especially amongst enterprise, which is the bread and butter for MS. Most users do not find it more user friendly, and quite a few have found it significantly more difficult to use. While I won't begrudge you for your obviously supportive position of the GUI, the fact that Windows phone, Windows RT, and Windows 8 sales have all cratered, so much so that vendors are in an uproar, speaks to the fact that you may be in the minority in enjoying the features of the metro gui. I hope that they don't take the option from you to continue running it, if that's what you enjoy, but please don't knock an operating system that you're obviously unfamiliar with and have come into with preconceived notions. Linux as it is, is perfect for advanced and beginner users. I'd say that the hardest group to get adoption from would be intermediate users. People who are clever enough to hack on their systems, but not patient enough for the learning curve that comes with new software. Reply Joel August 7, 2014 at 10:14 am All time windows user, been using elementary os for a few weeks, loving it! Reply Violet Lightning August 7, 2014 at 7:11 am In Windows 8, I prefer using Classic Start Menu. On Ubuntu, I nix Unity and install GNOME. I doctor GNOME's UI w/some extensions that are a 'throw back' to GNOME 2. So, for me, GNOME (altered) is better than Windows 8 (altered). Unity is a no go. Ergo, between Metro or Unity; Metro is the winner. Reply Burhan August 7, 2014 at 6:33 am Windows 8 UI maybe better than Unity, however Windows is not a better OS than Linux. I personally don't like both Unity and windows UI. I prefer more simple desktop and linux gives me such a choice, where windows doesn't. Reply Shiva August 7, 2014 at 6:30 am Troubleshooting Windows OS is most friendly and English based....... In Linux, we need to search for the articles every time for the same problem... becoz, no one can remember commands for each problem..... I vote is for Windows, even if it is affected by virus... I have my steps to solve them safely even though there is no internet connection..... Reply Stefan August 7, 2014 at 6:06 pm well, if you use linux once a year, of course you can't remember each command, but if is your daily desktop, you'll always remember all you need. But Linux of 2014, especially ubuntu works out of the box without needing anything. There was a time when Linux was hard to fix and you could spend hours and even days for a solution, but not these days. Also when is about really hard bugs from the OS, in windows mostly all you can do is wait for Microsoft for a fix, but in Linux you can ask on a forum and fix it right away in some cases. Reply Stefan August 7, 2014 at 6:41 pm From a programmer point of view, Metro UI is painful and if you're working on a 15.6\" laptop you're going crazy on windows. Workspaces, global menu, fast switch and moving windows between workspaces, hide/show terminal(Guake), lots of key combinations for shortcuts and others that I can't remember right now are some features that I can't live without not even to use my laptop for basic stuff. And on top of that add how hard and buggy can windows be when it comes to set a development machine. I must say that Ubuntu is doing a good job on this so far with Unity and no other UI is offering more working area than Unity unfortunately, at least for my needs. Also these days when you buy a laptop or computer with doesn't have windows preinstalled, you're forced to search on the producer website up to 2G of drivers and know all your computer components pretty well, while on linux all I had to do is to install bumblebee and bumblebee-gui to make nvidia work with optimus. All I'm using windows for these days are some games and compared to my linux desktop is very annoying (maybe because I'm used to press 2 keys and open/do what I need). But of course not everyone has crazy needs and need all kind of features, so each OS and UI is good for different group of people. The truth is, such posts of these, which is better, are just garbage. Each OS and each UI is the best for different groups of people. After all because of these needs we have so many OS and so many UI; at least for linux. Windows is closed source, so you get only what Microsoft wants (sorry windows guys), but even so are ways to make it look the way you want :D Reply Mike August 7, 2014 at 5:47 am The advantage for me in using Linux is NOT having to use Unity. I can choose from Unity, Gnome, KDE, Cinnamon, MATE, LXDE, XFCE, Enlightenment, etc., with just a few clicks. Every single element on the screen can be pretty easily customized, removed, or swapped out for something completely different. You can't do that nearly as easily with Windows 8, and definitely not with Microsoft's blessing. You have to use 3rd party hacks. With Linux, it's designed to be as flexible as you need it to be. Reply a August 7, 2014 at 5:31 am I must say both are great UIs. I don't have any problems with either, but I must say Ubuntu kicks the crap out of windows for this reason: I can get a install a new UI if I want to in just a minute or two. Bam! Just like that I've got lubuntu or something. And on the subject of the metro: just like everyone says it's great for touch screens and crap everywhere else. It just isn't useful on my non-touch laptop with my mouse. The menus take up way too much space and have way too little information. No right clicking slows you down too. Windows 8 was a huge step backwards in the UI department. The menus in 7 just had way more information and gave you way more options. Take the network panel for instance. On 7 it took a little corner of the screen and had plenty of info. On 8 the panel takes a quarter of my screen and only has three buttons and a list of networks. 3 BUTTONS! One for airplane mode, one for WiFi, and one that brings me into the settings in that stupid full screen mode. Even that settings thing isn't as good as the little panel in 7. And why does anyone want to open settings in full screen? I hope M$ got the message and will bring us a more useful windows 7 like UI. Oh wait, Linux is kicking the crap out of everyone as of late. M$ is already dead, can't wait for the coming golden age of Linux. Reply BEN August 7, 2014 at 4:39 pm sorry Microsoft is alive and well. its not dead. Linux golden age never existed.

Reply dragonmouth August 6, 2014 at 10:45 pm Inasmuch as I do not like Ubuntu, I would award it a landslide victory over Windows if only because of its security. Windows has a long way to go to match the security of Linux, let alone of BSD. Reply Pieter August 6, 2014 at 9:05 pm I'm using Windows 8.1 at home and Windows 7 at work. Out of those two I prefer 8.1. Compared to Unity (which I have used a little) I'd still prefer 8.1, mostly because I think it looks better and I absolutely hate it when the taskbar is to the side of the screen in stead of the bottom (or top). People who say Win 8.1 is only good for touch screens haven't used it enough. In Win 7 I don't use the start menu at all (except for the search function), in Win 8.1 I not only use the start menu, but I find it to be quite useful. I would like it if the start menu didn't fill the entire screen though. Reply Howard B August 6, 2014 at 6:43 pm \" Unity vs. Modern UI: Should You Choose Ubuntu Or Windows 8?\" Neither; Windows 7 and Gnome Classic/MATE/Cinnamon are great, and already familiar. Reply bben August 6, 2014 at 4:25 pm In my own experience, Windows 8 is the best reason I have found to switch to Linux. I have been working with windows since the very beginning - I recently helped a friend set up a new computer with Win8.1 - the word that occurs to me to best describe the experience is painful. It hurt to see just how badly the MS developers had shot themselves in the foot. I won't be getting Win 8 on any of my computers. I am steering anyone who asks about a replacement for WinXp directly to Ubuntu. Win 8 may be better for a touch screen pad or phone - but it was obviously never intended for a desktop environment. I have always liked Windows as an OS. I hope they come to their senses and make a better Win9. Reply Dark V August 6, 2014 at 11:06 pm I currently have win 8 and I like it - it's alot faster than 7, extra features etc... even installed it on my Lenovo Ideapad S10-2 -> netbook with 2 gb ram, and it works flawlessly, while win 7 is horribly sluggish (and before you say linux works faster - i know - i however use Visual Studio - which only works in windows)... my point being that win 8 is, for me, a great improvement to the OS Reply BEN August 7, 2014 at 4:44 pm from your experience, shows that you don't know how to use a simple UI, which is windows 8, which is fast and easy to use. Windows 7 is getting stale, Unbutu is one hopeless useless OS with lack of programs compared to the windows library of programs.

After all, if you don t go there, you re not going to have a lot of luck selling on Craigslist! Image titled Sell Items on Craigslist Step 2 2 Choose the state where you live. On the right side of the page, there is a list of big cites that may reflect your region. If you don't see your city there, at the bottom of the list are links to fine-tune your location. Click on the link that says US States. You can go right to your city by entering yourcityname.craigslist.org. For our examples, we ll use Portland as our city, and enter \"portland.craigslist.org.\" If there is not a listing for your specific city, choose the city that is closest to you. Be sure to post your ad on one Craigslist city only - posting the same thing to multiple cities is against Craigslist Terms of Use. Image titled Sell Items on Craigslist Step 3 3 Click on the post to classifieds button. It's on the left side, under the Craigslist logotype. That will bring you to a page that says: '\"What type of posting is this?\"' It gives you a list of posting types: Craigslist has both \"for sale by dealer\" and \"for sale by owner\" areas - generally \"by owner\" is for private individuals with just one or a few random used items to sell - if you are a recurring seller, either with an inventory, or you buy/make items to resell, be sure to chose \"by dealer\". Image titled Sell Items on Craigslist Step 4 4 Click the for sale button, will bring you to another category page. It features a list of about 100 categories. You can choose one. Click on the category that is most appropriate for what you're selling. If your item does not fit within any specific category, click on the category general for sale . For example, if you want to sell an old bicycle , you'd choose bicycle - by owner . When you click on that, you'll be asked to narrow down your location. Image titled Sell Items on Craigslist Step 5 5 Enter the posting information. This is the title and copy and other information potential buyers will see when they are searching for what you're selling. These fields are as follows: Posting Title : This is what people will see as the heading in their search results. Price : Obviously, how much you're selling the item for. Specific location: Enter your county, part of town, or other general information. Do not enter your address! Reply to : Put your email address here. You can choose whether to have an \"anonymous\" address created for this ad, or not. In \"for sale by owner\" this is generally the best choice, to avoid spam. If you are a dealer, you should list your business contact info in the ad body. There is also an option to list a phone number, and you can specify whether it is a number (cell) that can accept text messages. Posting Description . This where you do your selling. Make it interesting, make it catchy. If you don't know what or how to write sales copy, take a look at a catalog or newspaper ad you might have, and see how they do it. If it works for them, it'll work for you! If you are selling \"by owner\" be sure to use your own words in the ad to describe your item, you do not want the ad to sound like a dealer/commercial ad. Stick with facts, avoid hype. Be truthful here . If there are flaws that damage the value of the item, or there's a piece missing, or that your ex will be knocking on the door of whoever buys it let them know in advance. It may not help you sell, but it will help you avoid getting a reputation as an unreliable seller. Check \"ok for others to contact you...\" if it's fine with you to get unsolicited emails from strangers. Check your form . The fields in green must be filled in. Image titled Sell Items on Craigslist Step 6 6 Submit pictures of what you're selling. This is listed as optional, but if you want to sell something, do yourself and your potential buyer a favor, and fill as many picture slots as you can with high-resolution pictures that are as good as you can possibly make them. You want people to be excited about what you're selling. Be sure to post pictures of your actual item, and avoid \"stock\" pictures from the manufacturer or the Internet. When you're done loading in images, click the Done with images button. Craigslist allows you to add up to 24 images to your ad. (CL no longer allows links or external images for-sale ads.) Image titled Sell Items on Craigslist Step 7 7 Check your listing for accuracy. You want to make sure your listing will get the attention it deserves. If your listing needs changes, click on the Edit Text or Edit Images buttons, and make any changes necessary. Image titled Sell Items on Craigslist Step 8 8 Click on the Continue button. When you're satisfied your ad is ready for prime time, click the Continue button at the bottom of the page. If you have an account on Craigslist, your ad will be posted on Craigslist within 15 minutes. If you do not have an account, you will be sent a notification email that you must respond to for your posting to become active. Image titled Sell Items on Craigslist Step 9 9 That's it! You're just made an ad on Craigslist! Note that while you may see a notice that says the list is updated every 15 minutes, it may sometimes take longer, perhaps an hour or two, before your ad appears in search results or in the list.

Reply Anonymous December 4, 2015 at 3:51 am Calibre is powerful, but the interface is a little ugly I think, and especially when I used Plugin to remove DRM, I think it a little complicated. I used an alternative, epubor ultimate eBook converter. Reply Donald Richardson March 17, 2013 at 5:50 am There is so much info on MUO that I have only just found this! This is one I really must have! Thanks for this post. Reply Jeremy Garnett February 7, 2013 at 3:03 am Thanks. I didn't know about the plugins. Reply Loris Johnston January 26, 2013 at 4:26 am I have used calibre in the past. For the third time, I experienced a total loss of library. You CAN reinstate the library from metadata db. It DOES NOT reinstate your own catalogues (categories). If you have a large library, to redo this is time consuming to say the least. When I contacted calibre regarding this, the only thing they had to say was that the library could be restored from the metadata (which I stated in my original communication that I had done). Further in the same communication said that my \"bug\" was invalid. I have a library of a little over 300 books at the moment. Imagine a 10,000 book library! Reply Jeremy Garnett February 7, 2013 at 3:11 am I'm not sure about reinstating the library from metadata, but you can create a calalog of books through the Convert function. There's a great guide here: http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=118556 Reply Heather January 23, 2013 at 3:21 pm The only reason I'm not using it is that it makes duplicates of files you already have. Why does everything have to be in Calibre's specified folder? Can't it just make a database of file locations for ebooks elsewhere in your hard drive? I don't want to fully rely on a management system for organizing ebooks, it should also respect how I organize my files into intuitive folders. Reply Dan January 27, 2013 at 10:54 pm This is one of the most frequently asked questions on mobilereads. Unfortunately the calibre community is not only completely set in their way, they are disgustingly arrogant about it. Their typical answer is that people who don't see the calibre way are stupid and that calibre is not for them. Imagine an mp3 player, that would copy all imported mp3s into its own file structure. That would be totally ridiculous. Calibre could be a nice program, but as long as you have to copy all files into their structure and can't keep links to outside files, exactly like any other media library does, it's just unusable. And no, having a database with tagging and search etc. does not require all files to be kept in a black box. -1 for the arrogant and unhelpful community. Reply Aaron Couch January 27, 2013 at 11:12 pm Dan & Heather, You both bring very valid points and thank you for sharing this. It's too bad that it isn't different, but hopefully it will change in the near future. Thanks again for commenting. Reply Dan February 1, 2013 at 5:26 am Hi Aaron, Here is their official answer: http://manual.calibre-ebook.com/faq.html#why-doesn-t-app-let-me-store-books-in-my-own-directory-structure \"If you are still not convinced, then I m afraid calibre is not for you. Look elsewhere for your book cataloguing needs. Just so we re clear, this is not going to change. Kindly do not contact us in an attempt to get us to change this.\" But after all I am very optimistic about them relenting at some point. They say that if you sort your folders by author, you can't access them by subject, and that sorting in calibre is much more powerful than by file folder. Of course, that's totally right, but that's what you want to use calibre for, so you can browse independently from your folders. Whether the files are stored inside of calibre's black box, or in your folders is in no way related to how they are indexed by calibre. You could still search for a book by author, date, tag, subject or whatever you like, just that the path points to your external folder!!!!!! And if you have accidentally moved a file, calibre could just ask for the new location of the file. I'd say nearly every media library (zotero, itunes, media player) works that way. I tried zotero, and it does exactly do what calibre says can't be done: It does all the indexing, tagging and sorting for you, but allows you to keep files in your own folders. If it only had an interface as nice as calibre! I for example already have a big library, and can't risk to destroy the order that I have by importing everything into calibre. There is just too much risk involved, I don't want to experience what Loris did. My library contains many years worth of collecting and scanning thousands of documents, I am not going to trust any program to move them around and rename them. I often use google desktop search my files, and then look around in the same folder for related things. With calibre, this workflow would break. Another thing reason to keep books outside of the black box is that you may want to keep them together with other stuff, like the extras that came with the book. Thanks for your review. I totally agree btw. and think calibre is the best program out there for books. My annoyance is because I can't use it for my large existing library. cheers, dan Terafall November 6, 2012 at 7:04 pm Calibre is great.For me it's like vlc for ebooks Reply Jeremiah Iliffe October 28, 2012 at 8:09 am I've got to say I love Calibre.. use it for everything even though I have a kindle Reply Siddhant Chaurasia October 23, 2012 at 7:10 am Calibre has a really nice UI Reply Debbie Strain October 22, 2012 at 7:11 pm Very Interesting article.

Reply Aaron Couch October 24, 2012 at 8:08 pm Debbie, Although Calibre can be an eBook reader, it probably doesn't excel at that as much as it does an eBook manager. Thanks for the comment! Reply Lisa Santika Onggrid October 22, 2012 at 1:18 pm Calibre is so good after you accept the fact that you'll not be able to sort your books in your own file structure. I agree that it's better Calibre's way, but my OCD has been keeping me away from the library folder. I can't stand the mess created, folder management-wise. Aside of my personal quirks, I do recommend it to anyone. It's very powerful once you've added plugins to suit your needs.

No Way Out Reply Scott July 15, 2012 at 5:25 pm Erez, what version of Android are you using? On mine (LG Optimus with Virgin Mobile) when I tap on \"Settings\" I do not see the same \"Storage\" option you displayed. Mine says \"SD Card and Phone Storage\", then when I choose that I am only shown how much storage each area is using. Tapping on them does not show the more detailed breakdown in your screenshot or open a file manager. I truly wish my Android had a built in way of showing exactly what is using up all my space... I am always getting \"low memory\" settings. Right now it says my available internal space is just 38mb. Anyhow, you should probably update your article to clarify which version of Android has the built in Storage setting and file manager you write about since apparently not all have it. Reply Erez Zukerman July 15, 2012 at 5:45 pm Hi Scott, I use Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). If you do not have this option in your ROM, it is probably because your carrier disabled it for some reason. Android fragmentation is a huge issue, and this is an implicit disclaimer in all Android posts: Not all phones will have the same options, ever. Sad, but true. Reply alson January 3, 2013 at 7:30 am the thing is my storage shows 7 gb available on the sd card and when i open application in setings it just shows that 5.5 gb used and thats the limit it gives..whats happening to the rest of the 2 gb thats still free Reply Bumferry July 13, 2012 at 9:29 am I use app2SD which allows me utilise the little amount of storage available on my xperia arc S. easy to see what uses the most memory and the cache as well as moving apps from internal storage to the SD card where optional. It also lets you know what aspects of the app (widgets and the like) might not work if they are moved. it takes up very little space and has allowed me to utilise a lot of space on my phone and speed it up no end in the process. For a free app, its been a life saver. Reply Mac July 13, 2012 at 3:14 am I'm using Link2SD with a partitioned SD card. Simple and very effective!

Given good hardware that is not that old and does not have windows only crap devices in it... 1. Start with Linux Mint and the MATE version. Install it. Use it a while. 2. Get Debian stable and NOT Debian \"testing\". Testing is not the way to get the newest software. It is for reporting bugs no matter how stable it is sometimes. Yes the Debian way is harder the FIRST time and you must pick your parts; but now you can pick them similar to Linux Mint's with Mates fine work. You will have to simple set things to how you want them. 3. Debian stable have automatic SECURITY upgrades like none other. Do upgrades regularly and this can be automatic. 4. The way you handle needing a newer version is to get just a couple form Debian stable BACK-PORTS. Such as Firfox and Libre Office for BACK-PORTS. Once you do this everything upgrade the the best versions WHEN AND AS IT'S READY. This is a stable as you get and that means the least maintenance time after setup once. 5. All this is for smooth longevity and scalability should you need multiple systems. Scalability means you have one distro, one method, one set of packages (can vary per workstation need, I'm mainly talking about the base foundational core OS, UI and related base) across disparate hardware levels for more time saved and the fewest BUGS managing them. The stable version does not force a better reinstall periodically. The smooth tier version runs for about 2 years. Then and sometimes more importantly its the only one that can be upgraded to the new stable in place and work very well. Even then you can hold off 3 to 6 months and avoid practically any issues unless you hardware is extremely ancient and should be phased out and device/system upgraded. 6. Thing about Debian is it may piss you off on your very first install; but then you get why it is that way and it's simple for technical folks the second time. Mint is like fast food and Debian stable is like the grocer store. It's for cooks. 7. Window similar UI element is not \"borrowing\" from Windows. Windows did not invent them. Some are afraid people can't understand GNU/Linux is not Windows. But I have no problem optionally making it look like Windows (whichever version) and have screen element placement and functions exactly where YOU want them. I don't even care if you want the same bootleg icons, or Apples. You can mix and do whatever you want! You should. I think Mate (and others are fine) allows maximal interface choice AND run lean not bloated. It has more legacy which in this case means robustness and stability longer worked on. Mainly Mate has all the little matching OS/UI helper apps; that stay the heck out of your way and are an absolute requirement. I personally prefer the \"Applications/Places/System\" menu buttons, (and one bottom panel optionally) as you really get used to those fast. There not a lot of user interface acclimation to do when new users are coming from Windows. People already know. In conclusion the Debian packages and management system has no rival. This is 'pure' Debian. Meaning your get the stable security upgrades before anything. All your critical programs are already compiled for you in the Debian system and not Ubuntu packaging. There's more stuff. New programs start here first. You never have to compile; but it's easy to do; for any custom or unpopular needs. It the very heart of Linux and just works. Depending on your choice combination. I suggest ONLY installing what you need on Debian stable and trying out many distros on another install. This is the one to depend upon. Reply Adrien H. December 18, 2016 at 2:01 pm I'm still hesitant on what to choose. I've used a lot Fedora and Ubuntu as the first was installed on my work computer and the second was advised to me as a simple to use distro (7 year ago). Now I've encountered severe problems with the last Ubuntu release (why did I have to jump on it... Damn me) and decided it was the time to take a look elsewhere. I've installed Debian with KDE but I'm not sure that was the best choice. I thought it would be a good choice because I'm proficient with the command line (I always prefer console tools over graphical counterparts) and doesn't have a pronounced taste for last features but it looks a bit too naked out of the box and I don't feel like spending too much time setting it up. Or maybe it doesn't need too much effort to have something suitable to my tastes ? My main use is software development using IDE's (Netbeans, Android Studio, PHPStorm, Apache, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, a console (XTerm) and a console text editor (neovim)). What distro would you recommand to someone having a good experience with Linux, bash, console tools but doesn't want to spend too much time setting it up?

Reply Anonymous August 28, 2015 at 9:55 am I have conflicting views. I like both Xfce and Plasma 5 the two desktops that are the least likely to find at the same distro. Also I'm unable to find many distributions with Plasma 5 with the worst being linux mint and their stability obsessiness. As for what distro I would prefer, I would take anything with pacman on it.

Today is the first time I've ever installed Linux on anything, and I'm happy to say mint/cinnamon installed without a hitch on my test box :) Now ... Thanks for all this info, to you and your commenters :) I have more than 10, older than 4 year old lenovo desktops getting ready to go to a school in Fiji that has nothing - sometimes no power and likely not much internet, if any. Any and all recommendations for a quick and easy install that will give the students and the teachers - some of which may have never seen a computer - something they can use to increase learning, without having to learn about computers. For example - the terminal is not something they're going to *need*, but there are probably a couple of students that may muck around with it (and maybe build a new dist one day :o ) I was pretty impressed with the suite that came with mint, but you may know something more suited to schools, and if you do I want to hear it please ... Thinking about: * 5 year olds: think tux paint, starfall, rainforest maths, 2 of those suggestions need internet which they don't have ... * 8 year olds: video recording & editing, writing, photographing their artwork and editing it, blogging in a world with limited internet * 10 year olds: everything I've said times 100, and scratch or similar (locally installed) * 12 year olds - somewhere to write, explore, experiment * 14 year olds - consumers or creators? * all ages - getting connected in a place where connections are limited and so it goes ... These kids and their teachers haven't had computers before so if everything just worked when they plug them in and turn them on that would be great. Its all sounding very 'Sugata Mitra' ... If there's a distro suited to that - I'd love to hear about it - huge thanks for anything you suggest to support this small project :) Reply john April 5, 2015 at 8:10 am you need tahrpup, a tiny linux that shares ubuntu kernel and repo, use puppy pakage manager to get edubuntu learning game suites like G compris. build the distro from inside the OS and save back to disc. easy, it also has a one click install software repo of its own on the desktop, with librecad,gimp, blender, mixx, lmms, etc. for older kids. .runs inside 130mb of ram, loaded from cd or usb, no hard drive required. lighter, faster and more versatile and user friendly than those above. Reply Anonymous June 8, 2015 at 4:37 pm Install Lubuntu 14.04 with and unencrypted home folder and the lvm option clicked on. It's the most lightweight of the Ubuntu flavors, so you can install the Ubuntu Software Center without any hassle. Get that from the Lubuntu Software Center. Once you have Ubuntu Software Center, use it to add all LibreOffice packages and the Edubuntu stuff. Add Timeshift via the command line and make a snapshot for backup (this program is like restore points in Windows and it comes in handy). These are the commands to install Timeshift, and this is the only time you need to use the terminal: sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install timeshift Just copy and paste them in there and the password when prompted of course. Here is the link for that program: http://www.teejeetech.in/p/timeshift.html That's an easy install of a lightweight Ubuntu flavor. My 2005 Dell ran like a top when I installed it. It's Ubuntu with a traditional desktop that doesn't use much in the way of resources. There's a lot of support in Ubuntu forums and it's very easy to use. And USC is the best software center IMO. To summarize: Install with LVM. Update. Install USC. Add the Edubuntu stuff. (I'd also add LibreOffice and get Google Chrome instead of Firefox.) Timeshift for backup. Might want to change the wallpaper too. It's not pretty out of the box. Your installs should take about a half hour each.

Reply lp March 9, 2015 at 12:01 pm Precise Puppy can run the whole OS from Ram - lightning fast! Reply Colonel Angus March 8, 2015 at 5:53 pm Netrunner is a very nice distro, as well. Reply Riley Mullins March 8, 2015 at 2:10 am I went with LXDE on a Dell Latitude D620 that a client was going to toss out. Bought the internal Bluetooth card ($5) and a battery ($35), then installed an 80GB Crucial SSD that I had that was doing nothing and maxed out the RAM. This setup, boots up to the desktop in under 4 seconds. Reply Kenneth DeVries March 7, 2015 at 5:03 pm I have tried a LOT of distros, and ultimately came back to Xubuntu. I refurbish and rebuild laptops at Free Geek here in Portland OR, and we install Mint because it is similar enough to Windows that new users don't have much of a learning curve, but by direct comparison I still take Xubuntu. It's very stable and flexible, it updates frequently - sometimes daily, and the killer feature for me is its outstanding right-click menu, which gives you everything you would get from clicking the menu button in the corner of Mint or Windows - direct access to all applications and settings with one click on the desktop. When I right-click in Mint I can create a new folder. I use Cairo-dock which has the option of putting Mac-style popup docks on three sides of the window and a simple Conky desktop calendar and clock. There are also some very useful keystroke application launchers like Launchy, which can reduce reliance on the mouse, for those of us on the brink of carpal tunnel syndrome. In general Xubuntu is more Mac than Windows, but with the added Linux functionality of multiple workspaces - as many as you want. For people who don't fiddle much with their system, when transitioning from Windows, Mint is probably the best, but from Mac I suggest one of the buntus. Reply Kenneth DeVries March 7, 2015 at 5:40 pm I also run the same setup on a Dell Inspiron Mini, which hardly has any brains at all. It runs noticeably slower - things take a couple of seconds instead of happening instantly, and nobody supports that model's quirky graphics card any more, but otherwise it's a fully functional system that was completely crippled by ever-expanding Windows updates. Reply Von Adam Martinez March 7, 2015 at 3:28 pm I have Windows and Linux Mint on my desktop(dual boot). I only use windows whenever I got to use my desktop after lending it to my girl friend. Reply Dan March 6, 2015 at 11:06 pm When in doubt, use LinuxMint MATE. It is drop-dead easy. Once you've had your taste of Linux (including the use of the Terminal and editing oddly located configuration files) then you can venture out to the other distros. I've tried ElementaryOS and it also feels simple-to-use. It's like a child's OS that mimics OSX's interface. Reply Simen B March 6, 2015 at 4:53 pm For trying out distros from USB, I'd recommend a Windows app called YUMI. It let's you load any number of distros onto the same USB stick, so you don't have to go through the whole reformat+write process all the time. (I think the site is called pemdrivelinux.com, but I'm not 100% sure) I'm currently on Ubuntu/Unity, but I'm considering to make the jump over to Fedora. Also, I've always wanted to try setting up Arch, but I think I'll keep that project in a VM for well, obvious reasons. Reply Doc March 8, 2015 at 4:40 am The download is at http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/ - off by 1 character. :) Reply Doc March 8, 2015 at 4:44 am I heartily recommend redoing any old Windows XP systems that are too slow for Windows Vista/7 with one of the lightweight Linux systems like Mint or Lubuntu - not only will you make your system feel fast and responsive again, you're not leaving your system vulnerable to viruses and attacks by running a system that's not being security-patched any more. It's a win-win - you get to keep using your system, and we're not having another compromised machine sending out spam and viruses to us. Reply kt March 6, 2015 at 4:20 pm Great article and I agree with everything you said. You could have added pclinuxos to the list, because it's a rolling release and has mate, kde, and cinnamon, you have a lot of flexibility. Switching from mint to pclinuxos takes a little homework, mainly going from .deb to .rpm packages. Reply Lamees March 6, 2015 at 4:18 pm I thought you choose a ditro first then change the desktop environment, right?! Reply Doc March 8, 2015 at 4:39 am Most common combinations of distro and desktop environment can be found as a distro - Linux Mint, for example, is a combination of Ubuntu and Cinnamon/MATE. Xubuntu is Ubuntu with XFCE desktop manager. You can always do things yourself - install Ubuntu then install Cinnamon, then switch desktop managers - but then you wouldn't have Mint's pre-installed (non-free) codecs, which can be considered a plus by some. Reply Danny Stieben March 31, 2015 at 11:10 pm You can, but if you have multiple desktop environments installed on your system you'll see the all of the specific programs and settings for each one -- they don't hide if you use the other DE. It's much cleaner and simpler to do it this way, but of course at the end of the day it's always your choice. Reply Lamees March 6, 2015 at 4:16 pm Linux newbie here, tried a virtual machine first then did a clean Ubuntu installation. Using an old pc so changed a few desktop environments because unity was too slow. Wait, xubuntu is a desktop environment or a distro? Currently using xfce for its lightness. love finding problems and learning to fix them myself. Reply Tondar March 7, 2015 at 11:34 pm xubuntu is a distrospin from ubuntu. It's basically ubuntu with xfce as default desktop environment. Reply", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/distro-indecision-cheats-guide-choosing-linux-distribution/", "index": 0}

If you wanted re-enable it, simply repeat the steps above, and you should see Safe mode: ON rather than off. Let me know if that solves your problem!

You may have a stuck volume key/rocker and/or the power button. It s more likely to be the stuck volume key/rocker have them check to see if it s dirty/gummed-up and stuck in one position and see if that helps. Please let me know what happens.

Thanks Judy on August 20, 2016 Hi There, If you create a shortcut of that particular app that you want to launch in safe mode, you can do so while in safe mode. But you should be in normal mode when creating the shortcut. To run your app in safe mode, you need to copy your app to /system/app, for which you need root access. So only on a rooted device, it is possible. Thanks for commenting. =-) Christine on September 13, 2016 Hi, my friend is freaking out over this safe mode.

Unfortunately it didn t work :/ Reply Trevor on November 13, 2016 Why did you put it in Safe Mode, Was there something malfunctioning? You could try clearing the device cache to see if that helps.

Example T-Mobile Support Site Reply Vanina on November 13, 2016 My phone required a system update and when it was done the safe mode was on. I cannot clear the cache because the aps aren t even there. All apps i see are like contacts, camera, gallery, calendar . nothing like facebook, instagram, whatsapp . Trevor on November 14, 2016 to me, it sounds like a corrupt download and update. there are apps and software out there that say they fix bad installs, but I can t vouch for any of them. You can try to redownload the update via the system update option in the settings. If that doesn t work, and as little fun as it is, it may be best to reset the phone.

Reply Vinay sharma on June 12, 2017 I just remove my SD card it s working OK. Virus and male are should be in your SD try this . ? Reply megan on June 13, 2017 This is a great tip. Viruses can be on internal or external memory. If the virus is just on external memory, solving performance issues and preventing the spread of the virus is often as simple as removing the card. Of course, if you want to recover files on that card, you ll still need to remove the virus, and you probably want to run a virus scan on your device even after the card is removed just to be safe.

Reply Jamie September 15, 2016 at 7:30 pm Microsoft OneNote is definitely a strong contender to choose, however, it has one KEY drawback and highlighted today (9/15/2016). OneNote absolutely relies on the Microsoft OneDrive server working. Microsoft's OneDrive server today has been down for the better part of the day. What does this mean? Well, unless you previously loaded the notebook you wanted to use before the server went down you will not be able to make any kind of note. Nothing! This kind of situation is crucial to consider when looking at which notebook system to use. I am at a loss right now and trying to figure out a good alternative that works on both Mac and Windows.

I downloaded the full version but when I went to install it, said I couldn't install because I have some 32 bit office programs on my pc, and Onenote won't work. Not really excited about buying a new office suite, just to get a few more features in onenote, since I don't use office that often. Typical mess Microsoft makes of things.

I bet text search worked in '86. Reply Rob Nightingale July 20, 2016 at 1:03 pm huh, that's strange, James.

This is the #1 reason I can't stand outlook. Example: search for a word, say 'examples' type 'exa' - matches for example appears type 'example' - matches disappear type 'examples' - matches reappear (not tested with this exact word but that's not the point) I was just trying OneNote. So far, I found those things will keep me from it. If I would have had a windows computer, would have been otherwise, but can't take the battery hit of running VMWare ALL THE TIME. (Maybe works satisfying on an iPad? Don't have one yet though. My urge for good notes organisation maybe calls for a windows tablet.) 1. PDF-export breaks WITHIN lines (upper half of characters on one page, lower on next) - and I really need a way to export data for regular archiving, as well as for sharing with others. 2. Language settings for spelling does not work on Mac when typing English on a Swedish keyboard. No global or per notebook setting. Does not follow \"language settings\" in macOS. 3. Can not change datestamp on Mac nor web version. Reply Alan Henderson December 17, 2016 at 7:56 am I've had the same thing happen regularly with Evernote. I've been testing all the note taking products for a couple of days because I'm over Evernote's bloat. Been a paying customer since the beginning. The only thing it has that I'd miss is a great tagging setup. New kids on the block which are promising: the beautiful (but Mac and iOS) only Bear at $15 p.a.; and Dropbox's free Paper. Paper requires a Dropbox account and doesn't have tags but it's in Beta and may get them soon. I create my own searchable tags :- \\computer, \\important, etc. Reply VanguardLH July 12, 2016 at 12:43 am Too bad Microsoft decided to punish Android uses. Yes, they have an Android version of OneNote. It does NOT support locked (password encrypted) sections in a notebook. That means all my notes are inaccessible on my smartphone (unless I go to onedrive.com to access my notebook via web browser but their AJAX2 web site is slow and clumsy). Their Windows app supports locking so they know the code needed to port to Android. They just don't do it. They've been promising for over a year to add locking/encryption support. Yeah, like I'm going to wait around for them to make up their mind whether or not to port existing code. As for Evernote, not an option, either. Why? Remember that OneNote is FREE. So stop comparing payware features when discussing comparison to OneNote. If an alternative does not have the same features in their freeware version then they are NOT an alternative. OneNote can use notebooks in the cloud (okay, a server-side copy of the notebook) but also supports a locally cached copy of the notebook. You can access your notebook when offline. You can NOT access your Evernote notes when offline. If you are out of range of an Internet connection or simply don't want one at the moment, forget accessing your Evernote notes because they are only in your online account. Yes, Evernote includes offline caching if you pay for it but OneNote has this in their FREE version. Evernote is really way behind the marketplace regarding their feature set. It's as if they don't care about being competitive. Reply Rob Nightingale July 13, 2016 at 11:58 am You make some valid points, but if a user doesn't use some of the differentiating features, then relatively, the two packages can most definitely be alternatives... it's all about figuring out which features you actually need. Reply Stau July 11, 2016 at 9:10 pm I use memosnag (memosnag.com). If your main use case is saving stuff you find online and take notes / photos in an organized place, then memosnag is perfect and is 100% FREE! The browser plugin for Chrome and Firefox is a better option than clipper and pinterest. In fact you can capture pretty much anything: images, youtube videos, text, webpages... Everything is saved in the cloud and is accessed though you personal memosnag account across devices. There are no limits to the numbers of devices. You can also organize your content in folders (Collections) and share them with other users, publicly, or keep them private. The iOS app is very well done.

Reply Rob Nightingale July 13, 2016 at 1:49 pm It's that limited number of devices that's either going to push me to use OneNote, or keep on with the Premium package from Evernote.. I've not decided which yet... Reply Andrew T June 29, 2016 at 2:30 pm I just got word that Evernote is changing their free account, limited to just two devices. I'm using my phone, tablet, and computer web browser (no Linux version of Evernote). So I suppose I can live without the web browser, but if they're starting to put more limitations on basic accounts, how long before they kill basic accounts altogether. I found your article as a result... I'm no fan of Microsoft, but I'll give OneNote a try, and hopefully they don't follow suit and stop being free for unlimited devices. Reply Rob Nightingale July 13, 2016 at 1:50 pm What did you think of OneNote, Andrew? Reply Brett June 28, 2016 at 10:10 pm Rob - Quick question for you ... I tried importing my Evernote notebooks into OneNote using the Microsoft importer tool, but unless I'm missing something the URLs that appear on Evernote do not get transferred to OneNote. When I use the Evernote web clipper, the URL gets saved to Evernote in addition to the web content, so that I can easily access the original site again down the road. On OneNote, that URL is seemingly gone. Am I missing something? This seems like a critical oversight. Reply Rob Nightingale July 13, 2016 at 1:51 pm Do you mean URLS that you import from Evernote notes into OneNote are no longer linking to their respective sites (or are these internal links, linking to other notes?) Reply Ashish Bogawat May 31, 2016 at 11:46 am Quip has been improving dramatically over the last few months and I have seriously started using it instead of Evernote for work related notes.

I do most of my note taking as small snippets and OneNote is a little more clunky than I'd like on mobile. There have been many times that I had to force close the app because I couldn't interact with my notes anymore. The checklist in keep is much more user friendly than the one in OneNote. The freeform notes in OneNote are actually a con for me instead of a pro because I almost never use it and it makes using it for simple notes more cumbersome. That being said, OneNote on desktop is quite a nice app. Onetastic,if you haven't heard of it, is a great set of addons to extend OneNote.

Reply Rob Nightingale May 18, 2016 at 10:34 am Any tips on working around the issues, Kelsey? :) Reply Kelsey Tidwell May 18, 2016 at 5:56 pm Well, Rob, the most effective way of fixing a non-syncing notebook is to open another notebook, copy the contents of the first into the second, then delete the first. It's clunky, but it's saved me quite a lot of pain lol. This technique is actually recommended by the OneNote tech staff. Why they don't just reevaluate the syncing process, identify the holes in efficiency, and plug them instead of recommending a kludge like this is beyond me. Another sync situation involved (if I recall correctly) my having the same file open in two different locations at the same time, deleting an item in one, adding an item in the other, and something happening in between to where I got a message like, \"can't reconcile differences\" or some such. You'd think that it happened because of throwing too much at the system at once, but then isn't that episode the picture of collaboration? I'll say that Google Drive has never ever made a mistake in collaborative situations like that, so now if I use OneNote at all I have to be like, Step 1, now Step 2, now Step 3. Cautious. Ron May 6, 2016 at 1:54 pm OneNote has garbled my notes on several occasions, crashed on other occasions (thus losing the projects I'd been working on), and cannot maintain consistency across multiple platforms. I find all this positive praise to be counter to my experience. Coupled with Microsoft's latest creeping around like malware, and I'll just have to believe those of you having a great experience are the lucky ones. Granted, Evernote has its issues, which I'm desperately trying to get away from and looking for a viable alternative, but OneNote has been painful to use. I don't like these options. Reply Anonymous May 7, 2016 at 4:06 am Due to much of the same issues you're having, I'm using Google Drive as a pseudo-OneNote. It's not that hard to pattern Docs along the lines of OneNote pages, but it's also not as smooth. I can overlook that since all Docs format files take up ZERO Drive storage allotment...which begins at the free 15GB mark (as OneDrive USED to before the great New Years Day screw the pooch-fest). I was really getting into the handwritten note function in OneNote, and had a bit of angst over how that would survive going to Google Drive. Fortuitously, Google Keep had a recent update adding that very thing! Yay! I'm on Android, so when I make a quick handwritten note, I simply share it to Google Drive...done! My setup isn't flawless, but in lieu of not having a team of engineers to code another slick solution for me, it works pretty well I'd say. Reply Rob Nightingale May 8, 2016 at 3:46 pm Using Google Docs is an interesting alternative! I've always hated the user interface of GOogle Docs though, so doubt I'd go down the same route. Reply Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:06 pm Yes, the interface is bland in typical minimalist Google fashion lol. OneNote wins hands-down there for sure, and it's the one biggest feature I hated leaving for Drive. However, Drive's appearance can be drastically improved by displaying the files as graphical tiles, as in the various speed dial examples in Chrome and Opera and other browsers, or the Win 8/8.1/10 Start Page. Thanks for taking the time to reply! Happy Mother's Day! Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:27 pm There is of course 1 important issue with Google Drive: privacy. Everything you put in there is accessible & copied by Google. With the desktop version of OnNote you can save everything locally, encrypt, then upload to the cloud. Reply Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:44 pm I agree Peter. Nice to talk with you again, BTW. I don't ever put ANY sensitive information online. That issue has been brought up a few times on Google Forums, and Google reps assure over and over that all of your data is encrypted and secure. Google's assurances don't hold water with me because I don't trust Google at all, but neither do I trust ANY online service. There are no wholly honest companies, because they always reserve the right to change terms. No guarantees, so...no critical data online. Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:50 pm Addendum: case in point on no guarantees...Microsoft abruptly took away the free 15gb OneDrive limit, along with the companion free 15gb gained if you linked your phone to upload photos automatically to OneDrive. They dropped the limit to 5gb in total. Even though they later allowed previous users to sign up to retain their 15 or 30gb levels, it wasn't out of integrity. It was because of the firestorm that broke out over their scummy methods. But the point is, in both cases, they made major changes arbitrarily, because THEY wanted to...not because users had any control over it. How can they or any other online service be trusted? Well, none of them can. Rob Nightingale May 18, 2016 at 10:30 am There's always going to be an issue with privacy and security. In my own view, there is little choice but to make a trade between privacy and innovation. Data is currency these days. if you want great service, you need to abandon some of your privacy. Just be careful what, exactly, you give up. MaMtt May 10, 2016 at 3:00 pm How would one do this encryption process? Kelsey Tidwell May 18, 2016 at 6:00 pm MaMtt, The encryption I mentioned re:Google Drive is an automatic process that (I don't believe) the user has any control over. Sanjay May 6, 2016 at 11:17 am What about price? Evernote free version has monthly 60mb which is enough for enough savings But onenote has now only 5gb storage which is one drive storage Sooner it's going to be a issue That is the only reason that's stopping me to switch back to one note Reply Herman May 6, 2016 at 6:40 pm Indeed Sanjay, it seems nobody know that...

I've dabbled with them before, but was never truly satisfied, however it may work for you. It does seem that the recipes seem to be more favorable to syncing OneNote items into Evernote, rather than the other way around, so that would mean mainly using OneNote day-to-day, which might not be comfortable for you.

Hopefully this helps. Reply Auldtwa May 6, 2016 at 12:10 am I've been using OneNote for years. The huge feature is the Notebook/Tab/notes you mention. I used it for my law practice and kept copies of the statutes I used all the time on it. I was legendary for being able to find cites instantly. Before I traveled for 3 months in Europe, I made myself guidebooks from stuff on the web: Wikipedia, Lonely Planet, museum sites,city websites, etc. You can cross reference, for example, from museums to artists (you can use hyperlinks within OneNote notebooks or sections or pages). You can actually make PDF e books from your collection. My travel was before iPad came out, so I read my homemade guide books on a Kindle DX. Now any tablet would make it really simple. I keep my daily journal in OneNote on pages I set up as a template so that I always cover the basics of what I want to record. I've done this since 2013: I can instantly, for example, search and find when exactly I read Ready Player One or when my dog's last vet appointment was. The search feature is fantastic. Clip to OneNote is often clunky, but you can PRINT to OneNote for anything that you can print on paper. It is, in fact, my default printer. When you use the print-to feature, you can choose exactly where you want to stick the item. Even on the same page as something you saved earlier. I use Evernote for stuff I scan since my scanner has a direct-to-Evernote feature. I use Evernote for things I know I'm going to want to save from the web and mark up (like a page of book recommendations) --it is a little bit clunkier to check items off a list from a \"printed\" OneNote page. I'm now using Vivaldi as my browser (love it!!) and it doesn't seem to have a direct to OneNote gadget yet. But Safari does, and Firefox and the Microsoft twins. Basically, Evernote is good for quick notes and quick saves and for situations, like my scanner, where interconnected functionality is built in. But OneNote dances rings around it for rational organization. Reply Anonymous May 7, 2016 at 3:58 am You might research using Chrome extensions in Vivaldi, since it is actually a child of Chromium. I also like Vivaldi very much, though I've opted to use Opera Developer for now...another Chromium descendant. However, I'm keeping up with and installing every Vivaldi update that comes along...you never know lol. Anyway, the point is, I can run Chrome extensions in Opera due to the similar code, and I'd wager you can too in Vivaldi. I just haven't tried it yet. :) That would allow you to use the OneNote clipper extension...which I'm using in Opera. Good luck, and happy day. Reply Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:22 pm I recently switched from Chrome to Opera Developer too because of the \"VPN\" feature. I can confirm Chrome extensions can be added to Vivaldi, but often don't work well, they work a lot better in Opera. I had high hopes from Vivaldi but have been disappointed by the clunkiness, perhaps because I am not patient enough, not indulgent enough with this new program. I think I will stick with Opera.

Reply Rob Nightingale May 18, 2016 at 10:23 am Not sure if it would help, but if you use OneNote a lot, would it be worth changing browser (perhaps to Chrome?) Reply Anonymous May 5, 2016 at 4:50 pm I used Evernote for 2 years but got fed up with its poor, amateurish editing & formatting. Also it was terrible with tables. Then there is the organisation: Evernote relies on tags & a powerful search syntax, which is fine & necessary to find your notes, but I prefer the visual to the bucket-type organisation of Evernote. OneNote's search is more than adequate. 1 year ago I decided to switch to OneNote & have never looked back. I have worked out an organisation model which combines notebooks, tabs/sections, tables & tables of contents, and keeps my pages/notes to a minimal level. This way I have everything within easy reach, particularly with the visual & OneNote's search. 1 thing about the free version of OneNote: it has 1 or 2 fewer features than the desktop version. I don't use the free web version but if I am not mistaken 1 of the missing features is OCR. I have looked at a number of other note-taking apps, including wiki-style apps, some of which have features OneNote does not have. Nothing is perfect in life so one has to set priorities & make compromises. Each time OneNote came out on top, hands down. All of these comments represent my humble opinion & are based on my use case. Reply Rob Nightingale May 8, 2016 at 3:49 pm Yea, I think it's the same with the Mac version. One crazy thing I really miss in OneNote is the ability to search for notes using Mac's spotlight. If they had that feature, I would probably abandon Evernote altogether. Reply MrBrady May 5, 2016 at 4:48 pm Interesting article. Thanks for posting! I've always shied away from OneNote only because it's part of Microsoft Office and I don't like Office, especially the Mac version. But after reading this article I'll give it a try. Reply Auldtwa May 6, 2016 at 12:15 am I believe OneNote was originally an independent app that Microsoft bought and simply provided along with Office. So you can think of it as the UnOffice part of Office. Reply Stefan Wischner May 6, 2016 at 6:07 am Not exactly. To be precise OneNote was a \"private\" side project from a Microsoft employee (John Guin if I am right) and soon became the \"killer app\" to promote the unsuccessful Windows XP for tablets in 2003. After that died OneNote has been a rather expensive stand alone program and was bundled into MS Office 2007 for the first time. It received a few connectors to other office modules to make it look as a part of the office suite but works perfectly without Word or Excel installed. OneNote 2013 was the last version which could also be bought separately. In 2014 Microsoft started the Mac version, offered a stripped down version of OneNote 2013 for free (basically without the option to store notes locally and without the connectors to other Office modules), rebuild the iOS version and introduced an Android version. All for free except the one still bundled with office and offering the most features. Greetings from germany, Stefan Wischner, Microsoft MVP 2015, 2016 for OneNote. Reply Auldtwa May 6, 2016 at 6:27 am Thanks. I knew it wasn't entirely Office-y. I used it before 2007, so my company must have bought the stand alone part. Rob Nightingale May 8, 2016 at 3:50 pm It's definitely worth giving it a try MrBrady :) Reply Roberto May 5, 2016 at 4:48 pm I was used to use Onenote along Keep, Asana and the paid version of Evernote. Since I have subscribed to Office365 I decided to get rid of all note taking apps but Onenote. Because of the nice integration of Onenote with Outlook Tasks I don't need neither Asana anymore. I have used a free tool to import all my notes I had in Evernote to Onenote. So far I'm still happy with the decision and I'm not going back. Reply Rob Nightingale May 8, 2016 at 3:51 pm Did you find reorganizing your Evernotes in OneNote easy? I might do this soon, but I have well over 10,000 notes, so am a little scared of the mess it could make... Reply Roberto May 9, 2016 at 12:38 am Migration wasn t so flawless especially with the notes that were clipped from web pages. (formatting issues, missing pictures) If I could go back I would at first delete all irrelevant notes from Evernote. For clipped webpages I would open the pages in the browser from the original link in Evernote then clip them again with Onenote clipping tool as the result with Onenote clipping tool is far better than with the Evernote one. Reorganization in Onenote is more easy as you can easily drag and drop pages from one tab to another or copy/move a whole bulk of pages at once. I didn t have so many notes in Evernote like you. I had \"only\" about 2000. Reply Rob Nightingale May 18, 2016 at 10:22 am Thanks Roberto.

What phones don't overheat a lot? Reply Chandler July 10, 2018 at 8:44 am I have two Android phones (Samsung Note3, Redmi 4X) that both suffer from overheating after falling on the ground for several times. Take Redmi for example, before the impact I read about 50 degree/122F for SoC in CPU-Z when charging and now the number increased to 75 degree/167F. And this overheating could occur for no reason from time to time even when my phone isn't being charged (Sometimes when I browse Twitter the temperature could exceeds 60 degree/140F easily, and Twitter is obviously not a power-intensive application). Something must be wrong with my phone but I just couldn't figure it out. The outside of the phone still looks intact after the fall: the screen was not broken and functioning well (thanks to the casing); earpiece, camera, and fingerprint sensor are all working perfectly. Usually such heat could only come from three sources: running massive game/benchmark applications, continuous UHD/4K video recording, and short circuit. The first source is easy to exclude since I did not even have a single game installed on my phone, and I did not have a benchmark app either. Based on the amount of heat generated I then suspect that I was being spied by some trojan backdoor on my camera. However, after I removed SIM card and disable wifi, bluetooth, the heat continues, and I observed no significant diskspace change on my phone during overheating. That left short circuit to be the most likely source responsible. But where could that short circuit be in? Battery? SoC? How can my phone suffer from an internal short circuit but still works normally? I am really at my wit's end now. Reply Ruth June 18, 2018 at 6:15 am I keep my Android in my back pocket.

I do have a flexible plastic case on the phone but it got hot even without it. I also wrap a cloth around the ice pack. I can get the phone too cold, at which time the touchscreen can get wiggy. So I take it off and let it warm up again then back on the ice pack. I'm considering getting a Z3 (no plus) instead but will probably still need to use the ice pack when I spend a long time on Pokemon Go. Until Niantic solves that problem and lessens the resource hogging of the app, anyway. Reply Christian Cawley August 26, 2016 at 2:12 pm Yeh, that doesn't sound particularly safe! Saying goodbye to Pokemon Go seems the best option.

May 3, 2016 at 10:24 pm I suppose the idea of \"underclocking\" the phone's CPU won't work? Ultimately a lot of the heat is just a matter of the CPU (which is just a glorified over-organized silicon space-heater) being overworked. There really should be a way to throttle back the clock rate to reduce this... But apparently there's not. Reply Arsham April 29, 2016 at 2:36 pm Hi Christian, I was having issues with the phone getting really hot. It may require the phone to be rooted to work optimally though. So what would you recommend to do? Regards Arsham Reply Christian Cawley May 2, 2016 at 8:03 am Do you know why, or suspect which app is causing the phone to overheat? Reply jay March 1, 2016 at 12:17 am I've drilled holes in my plastic case to help get air to my phone to help it cool. I used to do this to the cheaper snap on cases for my iPod touch it does help. Reply Christian Cawley March 1, 2016 at 9:49 am Nice idea, Jay, thanks for sharing! Reply Viera Mosberger-Uvacek February 28, 2016 at 10:32 am Hi Christian. You say \"never charge y phone up to 100%\". Pls explain, how a usual phoneowner can manage this in a practical way??? I can not walk over there every half an hour just to have a look at the percentage of battery. Charging over night, as probably the biggest part of the people are doing, brings 100% in the morning;-) So what would you recommend to do? Regards Viera Reply Fik of borg February 28, 2016 at 1:54 pm Most phones drop to trickle charge after reaching 100%, so this is somehow controlled. It is conceivable an app with an adjustable \"drop to trickle\" level, but I haven't seen one (just hundreds of \"battery saving\" apps that just shut down systems). Failing that, some external hack that turns off and back on the charger at selectable levels, controlled from the phone via wifi (or bluetooth, or even the earphone jack). Maybe one of those wifi controlled home automation AC outlets. I smell project. Reply Christian Cawley February 28, 2016 at 4:29 pm Hey Viera I think Fik makes a good point, as it is impractical often, so a project that makes use of smart plugs might be ideal.. I'm in a position where I can charge during the day, but obviously that's not the case for many. In my case, I imagine I charge overnight - and therefore to 100% - about 30% of the time.

We would love to hear your comments and suggestions. Reply Justin December 21, 2018 at 2:12 am I think you do your readers a great disservice when you make such a broad claim as \"absolutely NO FREE VPN service works with Netflix\" simply because you subscribe to the rediculous notion that it's possible for you to test every vpn provider that exists on the planet earth whether it be in the past, present and future. Narrow-minded self importance does not, nor will it ever, impress me. Thankfully I have tested a free VPN service available in the form of a browser extension (or an installable windows executable file that can be found elseware on the web but for some reason is not available on the official website [anymore?]) that has, does and likely will continue to work for Netflix in the forseeable future - for reasons that I won't go into here but is information that can easily be found on their official website explaining what apparently makes it different from other free vpn servers. It's called Tuxler. Now, go try it out and then I think you owe us all an sincere apology for making such a silly statement. If I have learned anything when it comes to computers and the internet as well as life in general it's this: anything is possible. Reply Bem November 5, 2018 at 1:49 pm NordVPN still works fine for me. I was already getting ready mentally for the day to come when I will not be able to access US Netflix with Nord anymore, but it hasn t come yet. It s been a year since my mate told me he wasn t able to access it with another VPN that he used at the time and I barely get any problems when using Nord. Some servers are blocked of course, but the majority of the newer ones are always up and running so you just need to switch the server a couple of times at most. If anyone is still struggling to find a working vpn go for it, they have awesome deal for Black Friday that they ve been sending trough on emails, the code was vpn3y or 3ysale can t remember which one, but let me know if any of these work. Reply David Martin October 21, 2018 at 8:29 pm In your article it says: Netflix Countries: ExpressVPN only worked for US consistently. Some of the other nations, especially Canada, end up working at times, but it s not a connection you can bank on. Does this mean that if you have a US Account with NetFlix and you want to use it in another country it would not be reliable? More importantly if you use ExpressVPN, or any of the other ones you mention, will this work only with a computer browser? I have little interest in watching movies in a browser on computer but want to use my Apple TV 4K (connected to my home WiFi) to display the show on my large TV. Will this work?

UltraSurf is totally free and works on Netflix !However, it is different, you can't choose a country you only can turn it on or off... But once you trun it on, it unlocks the US Netflix so I do not complain! :) I used it yesterday so I'm pretty sure it will still work today! ;) It is available as an extension to google chrome which I use but I think you can download it if you go on their website!

The web site also offers a free version which will work but it is not as fast as the paid service, but you can still access Netflix and other sites. Again, search for trimium in your favorite search engine. Reply James Ferguson February 10, 2017 at 5:24 am Thank you for posting about Trimium. I tried it and it works great! Today is February 9 2017. They support other regions too (Canada, UK, Japan and more.) Reply Nicola Peffers October 18, 2016 at 11:38 pm Add ExpressVPN and it's linux equivalent OpenVPN to the list!

Reply Rompe Himself September 20, 2016 at 1:14 am Getflix (Paid) has had a huge amount of issues getting Netflix to work for them. First they offered a litany of countries to access then that became the U.S. and U.K. servers only, then 5 U.S. servers (Central, West, East and 2 Test) then 3 and now one and that one is so sporadic in working. I have mine set to Off for the past 2 weeks because it is so unreliable and I am looking to leave Getflix for it. Getflix claims \"Our Network Engineers are still engaged for the resolution of this issue using a Newer Approach. We don't have specific time frame for the fix since the Network Team is using a new approach and it is taking a while to make sure that it will work. \" They have been saying that for many months with no concrete results so yeah, add Getflix to the list.

I move about, I have used proxies and VPNS, but I would be quite willing to pay extra to be able to keep watching when not in US or UK. Where I am now I get German Netflix, which has a poor selection and the range of titles tend to be restricted to violent or overtly sexual content which I do not want to watch. The crazy thing is that I have been strongly against watching pirated films, I appreciate the film industry needs paying for their work, but it's time they woke up to the simple fact that we are in a global market and their geographic restrictions are last century. but is there an option for me? So now I shall save money, the distributors don't get their contribution from me and Netflix looses another customer. Quite a clever way to destroy the film industry I suppose.

Very easy...but one and only one way...and you can only do each track, or complete album 3 and only 3 times. You have to trick your android device into believing it is a computer by switching chrome browser to desk top. You have to access the google play music web site where your music (purchased & uploads are stored) by bookmark (only!). So, you have to enter the url then make it a bookmark. Then, after switching to desktop mode in your chrome browser, select the google play music bookmark. The url you need to enter is as follows: https://play.google.com/music/listen#/home It may ask you to log into your google account. It will then load your entire google play music library and you will be in the home directory. Simply select \"MUSIC LIBRARY\" then select \"ARTIST\" at the top bar. You can then select any artist in your library. It will show you several categories....go down to \"MY LIBRARY\" and select \"SEE ALL\". Simply pick an album...you can either download the whole album, or pick a track. To download the album click on the 3 dots...then select \"DOWNLOAD ALBUM\" in the pop up menu. It will take you to another pop up menu titled \"DOWNLOAD MUSIC\". Click on the underlined words \"download directly\". This will give you yet another pop up window also entitled \"DOWNLOAD MUSIC\". Click on the orange words \"DOWNLOAD NOW\"....and wait until its finished downloading. Your album will be a portable zipfile in your download directory on your android device. Unzip it and it will create the proper directories, artwork, trac numbers, everything, as mp3 files that can be ported, or played in any music player....my favorite is JetAudio....check it out. Reply Steven L Stern March 3, 2019 at 4:52 pm I just wanted to say thank you. Your article explaining how to get music from my Apple computer onto my Android phone was the only one I found that was truly helpful. So, thanks!! Reply Mark McGriff December 21, 2018 at 1:05 pm The work-around for the 1,000-song limit on playlists is to just make multiple, generic >1,000-song playlists. It takes very little time to do that. Once the playlists are downloaded to the phone, the songs can be manipulated in the GPM app by genre, etc., regardless of the fact that they were downloaded as playlists. Not sure if the playlists can be deleted after this method. Probably so, but there's really no reason to do so. Reply Me December 17, 2018 at 4:08 am If you change your download cache location to use your Sdcard, you dont need root, as all files will now be located on the sdcard. Reply Alex December 8, 2018 at 5:20 pm If i delete that temporary playlist will the music stay on the phone? Reply knw November 10, 2018 at 6:27 pm I agree this is less than ideal, but it DOES work. I just downloaded 6000 songs, 1000 at a time, and it took about 5 minutes to follow this method. Not a big deal. Too bad Google doesn't make it easier. Reply Annoyed User July 2, 2018 at 1:33 pm Like a fellow already mentioned - this does NOT WORK, since playlists are limited to 1.000 songs. You could however make various batches of playlists to do this. It's a pretty dumb and slow process though. And Google Play Music is more like the \"Worst music player\"for android than anything else. Reply Sarah March 12, 2018 at 10:40 am Thank you, so helpful. I'm just wanting to download music to put on an MP3 for my kid who does not need internet access at all times, very helpful!! Reply TomB March 7, 2018 at 10:00 pm Come on Google make this easier then it is. Reply Yoel February 11, 2018 at 11:32 am This does NOT work. Playlists are limited to 1,000 songs. Reply Parker December 21, 2017 at 3:47 am Thank you, very helpful dont know why Google play can't have an easy option to do this on your phone Reply Gabe October 3, 2017 at 10:04 am You don't need to root to find, name and move the files. Any file explorer can do it. Reply SJ September 27, 2017 at 9:55 am Thanks! That made a very non-intuitive process easy to understand! Reply Bronco billy July 1, 2017 at 1:15 am There should be an easier way to retrieve personal music /recordings that were uploaded to the app before lost on device.

Reply Andy Giroux November 8, 2016 at 8:53 pm Unfortunately you have to use multiple playlists if you have over 1000 songs because Google limits the length of a playlist to 1000 songs. Reply RoxAnne November 23, 2016 at 4:49 am I found a way around that. If you select them like mentioned here and then thumb them all up, there's an auto 'thumbs up' playlist that can have more than a thousand and you can download that.

I checked the file through the hex editor, a typical header hex for mp3s (0x 49 44 33) is not present anymore. It looks like they've encrypted mp3 files in the newer version of play music (DRM maybe?). Reply Kshitij April 23, 2017 at 9:07 am Yup. They have applied encryption on the songs.

Reply Marsha Vayvada July 8, 2016 at 3:26 pm Okay. Is this method we can use to save songs my daughter has purchased from Google play over the last couple of years? We're turning off data package on the phone (too much data usage) but don't want her to lose the the years' worth of songs she's purchased. We don't have a monthly subsciption have purchase songs individually. I could use some advise. Reply {capachino} July 10, 2016 at 5:33 pm Yes, this is Thee method to to save all songs, from Google Play Music, to a smartphone so that they can accessed offline without the need for any data or even Wi-Fi usage. I recommend a (micro SD card Class 10) as storage for the music as well (I prefer Samsung SD cards because I've heard rumors of some problems that can arise with SanDisk. These problems may be totally false, but I just like to play it safe). The amount of storage (32gb, 64gb, 128gb) is up to you to decide. Reply Gabrielle May 27, 2016 at 11:32 am Thank you for this! Worked great and was exactly what I needed. Reply MAnny 215 May 13, 2016 at 9:37 am It's kind of ridiculous that I'd have to rename purchased mp3 names if I wanted to use them elsewhere. Sucks! Reply Rob May 12, 2016 at 1:53 pm While this idea seems great in concept, it fails because if you download via a playlist, those albums do not show up in your collection unless they are mp3's you own. So let's say you add a bunch of albums to a list, download it, and then want to listen to just one album from that list offline. You can't. Not unless you go to the playlist, find the album in it, and play from there. Obviously, this is pretty tedious. Especially if your playlists are not ordered well or if an album spans 2 lists because of that stupid 1000 limit. Playlists should add all of the albums (even if it has one song) to the library but Google does not think this is a good idea (they have told me that...for reasons). What I REALLY want to see, and I can't even believe this is not a thing, is the ability to indicate via the web that I want a song to be downloaded to my phone. This could be as simple as \"try to fit everything indicated into whatever space available\" or there could be profiles for your different devices. Much like Google Play has you choose where to install an app. If the former were implemented, the mobile apps could have a switch that says whether or not to allow auto-download of pinned songs. This is all a pipe dream though because I have given them feedback over and over and no one listens. They seem to think that everyone should just stream. Like we all have unlimited data or are always on wifi. Reply Rob May 12, 2016 at 1:56 pm Also, the nice thing about the web download tag is that if you get a new device...bam! All your metadata is saved and you don't have to go through the whole process again. I have about 8,000 songs offline and when you get to about 3-4K, the app slows to a CRAWL between hitting a button and a dialog opening. Reply Mathieu August 5, 2016 at 2:49 am I don't understand either why the songs in my playlists doesn't appear in the song tabs of my music library. I guess like you said that google think that everyone just stream. Reply Kevin September 12, 2016 at 4:26 am I am absolutely Blown Away by the sheer stupidity of this design decision. Google Music has to be the worst designed music player app I've ever used Reply Muchtall May 2, 2016 at 6:59 pm Thanks for posting this. This is the first workable solution I've come across, and although not perfect (due to the 1000 song playlist limit), it's closer than any other solution I've found. Please consider updating your article with some info about how to work around the 1000 song limit. I personally select the first 1000, take a note of what song is the 1000th, make a playlist called \"0-1000\", then repeat starting with the last song I had selected. A pain for sure, but again, better than the (lack of) alternatives. Reply Sam April 21, 2016 at 4:55 am There is an easier way to download all your songs. Just go to Playlists and download the \"Last Added\" Playlist. The Last Added Playlist is automatically generated by play music and it will always be up to date with all your songs.

It will automatically save anything that is in your play queue to your machine with meta tags and album art! Its by far the fastest and easiest way to do this... Reply Trevor January 2, 2016 at 3:19 pm Nice suggestion. Spotify in addition to allowing downloading Playlists, Albums and Songs also allows you to download an artist which is very convenient. I started downloading albums after I had grabbed individual songs I liked from various artists, not realizing that google play grabs the whole album even if you have one song that you selected from the Album. That sucks. I'll do the above to keep my playlists under control. Reply Ace December 28, 2015 at 5:42 am Update!!!! Just checked and now Google Music no longer has this restriction as long as your using Google Chrome to download on PC. You have to use the Google Chrome browser or there Music Manager.

Any suggestions? Reply Anonymous October 16, 2015 at 3:24 pm If you copy the files to your internal storage or sdcard you'll be able to play it as normal with any music player of your choice.

Very strange that this article doesn't mention this limitation. Of course, I can just make four separate playlists to download entire library, but both the fact that playlists are limited to 1000 songs and the fact that there's no simple, dedicated way to download your entire libary to your phone is just ridiculous.

I put my entire lib into 6 playlists and downloaded these. The songs are can be played in offline mode. But SOME of the songs don't appear in the artist-section or the titles-section. It' s really frustrating, because it's inconsistent. Most of the titles can be accessed, but some can't. Any help for that issue? Reply hakluyt December 27, 2014 at 3:19 am Contrary to advice above I find the two download limit has no workaround. Music Manager for Windows lets you download your whole library. 'Download free and purchased' is greyout out. 'To download a specific song, visit the music player'. Once there obviously you're under the 2 song limit rule. Reply Chris December 25, 2014 at 3:22 pm Google Limits you to 1000 songs per playlist but the maximum in the library is 20,000 songs so you need to make 20 playlists if you are at capacity.

Reply SH June 2, 2014 at 5:22 pm This is a great article. Ever since switching from iTunes to Google Music I've been downloading my music to my phone one album at a time, so this article will be a great help. Three quick questions: (1) it seems that a playlist on Google music has a limit of 1000 songs - is there any way to get around that limit; (2) if the new playlist includes songs that are already on the phone, does the app skip those songs during download, or does it download a duplicate; and (3) if I don't have a rooted phone, can I plug the phone into the USB on my computer and use Windows to move the songs to a SD card. Again, many thanks for this article Reply Justin D June 2, 2014 at 5:40 pm Thanks :) glad to help. I went back and tested what you asked, and this is what I found. 1) I don't think there is a way around this. If you have more than 1,000 songs, I would suggest making multiple playlists of 1,000 songs each. 2) In my testing, it does NOT download a duplicate. Good news! 3) This is a GREAT question, because it led to this discovery: If you go into Play Music's settings and set it to save to an external SD card rather than internal (assuming you have an external microSD), you can easily access all the files on that microSD card without root access. However, if it saves the files locally, they seem to be hidden in a part only accessible with root access. So if you have a microSD slot and card for your phone, you could connect to your Windows computer and move the files off with no problem, but unfortunately it doesn't seem possible without an external microSD to save the offline files to. Reply SH June 2, 2014 at 8:09 pm I just completely filled up my internal storage. Seems that the option to save to SD card is device specific and I'm out of luck. Oh well, c'est la vie. Reply Rick June 2, 2014 at 3:08 pm \"for some reason, Google only allows each song to be downloaded to your computer twice. \" I'm pretty sure this two download limit does not apply if you use the Google Music Manager application: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1229970 Also, unless something has changed since I tested it when it first came out, that also was not the case if you used the new Google Play Music app for Chrome, at least on Chrome OS, as described here: http://www.omgchrome.com/browser-uploading-now-available-google-music/ And when using either of these options you get a file with the artist and song name. That said, I have done it the way you describe as well in Android a few times. Reply Justin D June 2, 2014 at 6:11 pm Ah, I just went back and tried it, and you're right. It seems you can download it unlimited times. Thanks for pointing that out! That's strange, though, because in the past, even on Windows 8 with Music Manager installed, it would warn me about the 2 download limit.

Two ways are available for connect your phone with pc via this app. They are USB connection and Wi-Fi connection. Step 1 connect your phone with pc For USB connection, connect your phone with PC, open the USB debugging, then a management interface would be displayed. Photos are classified in the left list of the interface. Click photos and enter the album interface to pick the photo you wanted. Step 2 transfer your photos to PC Click \"export\" button, then your photos would be exported to your computer files. The third-part option is also a good choice.

Reply Becki Zeipen November 20, 2016 at 9:43 pm I was very unhappy with the automatic/unwanted update as well. I found a note on another site and the advise given was to go to your control panel, then system and security, then security and maintenance, then recovery, then open system restore. I restored to a date before the update took place, which was 11/13/16 on my computer. I now have the previous version and was able to edit photos as I had done on 11/12/16. Yeah!!!!! I then went to my Microsoft store settings and made sure the automatic update button was toggled off. Reply Missie T. December 1, 2016 at 7:12 pm Hi, Becki. I tried everything just as you listed. But to no avail. When I get to \"restore to date before\", I find that Windows has automatically set a date three days prior to the current date. I tried to manually override that, also to no avail. Windows will not let me. I tinkered around and thought I had conquered this, re-booted my computer, then went in to restore, found my \"restore\" date, thought \"Ahha! Maybe it worked!\". When I went into my photos, the same ridiculous photo-editing program is still in place. I cannot seem to get rid of it and go back to the original program. Currently, I am researching online options for other Photo-editing programs, but so far, I have not found any that are even close to the Windows programming I had just a couple weeks ago. Reply Joe November 20, 2016 at 1:37 am it would be great if file names were displayed and also if it were possible to select which files types (eg jpg but not raw) in a directory to display. Reply Debra Ruth Poliquin November 18, 2016 at 6:50 pm I too was shocked to open the app and find it completely replaced. I do find that many of the new features are good, but like other comments have noted, there are some great features of the old app missing. I miss the shadows button also. I DO find that the \"enhance\" feature in the new version works MUCH better than in the old. My BIGGEST COMPLAINT is that when using the \"spot fix\" feature, when you enlarge the photo to get at small defects, you cannot move around the photo. I take photos of small jewelry items. So most of my photos are very close-up and so even specks of dust will show up in the photos. When I enlarge the photo, I can't move around any longer. I used to be able to click the left mouse button and then move the mouse and go to any part of the enlarged picture and clean up dust and other defects. There is only one size button for \"spot-fix\" so it doesn't' work on my tiny items when it is normal sized. I hope that makes sense. Now I will have to find another editor to work with because of that ONE really important feature being gone. Otherwise, for me, most of the new app I can live with. If anyone knows of a way to move around the photo when it is enlarged and using \"spot-fix\" please let me know. Thanks! Reply Missie T. November 17, 2016 at 1:07 am Yesterday--11-15-16-- while photo-editing, everything as described above was in place on my Windows 10 photo app. And I have had it in place since we got Windows 10 in April, and have been using it successfully since--gradually getting more and more familiar with it. Today--11-16-16--when I went to edit photos, the entire photo editing program had changed. Completely changed. Does anyone know what happened??? Reply bella November 17, 2016 at 7:27 am Mine too and it is a horrid app. So unhappy. Reply JHDet November 17, 2016 at 2:46 pm Same thing happened to me! Very distressed. Reply David Haith November 18, 2016 at 12:14 pm Same thing with me - and the nbew version doesn't have a Shadows button which I found very useful. How can I get the old program back please? Reply David Haith November 18, 2016 at 12:19 pm No idea why this has happened - sorry. I miss the Shadows button If you find a way to download the old prog please message me under my name on Facebook Or look up a contact for me under UFOs Thanks Reply Becki Zeipen November 20, 2016 at 9:44 pm I was very unhappy with the automatic/unwanted update as well. I found a note on another site and the advise given was to go to your control panel, then system and security, then security and maintenance, then recovery, then open system restore. I restored to a date before the update took place, which was 11/13/16 on my computer. I now have the previous version and was able to edit photos as I had done on 11/12/16. Yeah!!!!! I then went to my Microsoft store settings and made sure the automatic update button was toggled off. Reply Kathy D January 5, 2017 at 3:39 am Will I lose everything I've done since that date if I restore back to 11/13/16? Reply HikingMike November 16, 2016 at 8:37 pm How do you view actual size of the image in Windows 10 Photos viewer? It seems to enlarge images that are smaller than the window, which of course makes them blurry if they were sharp before. How is this not an option? Not every image is a photograph or larger than the screen size. Reply IMRAN November 14, 2016 at 6:45 am Aren't these things almost every Photos app on the planet offers since the last 10 years? Yet, in 2016 Microsoft's own boards have people begging for a way to select multiple images without having to click on every single one. e.g. choose 78 photos out of 178 in a series, and you cannot click and drag, at least according to MS' own (no)Help pages. Mind numbing. Reply jim hempleman October 30, 2016 at 10:11 pm 1 change white sky to blue. 2 copy a face or other item from on photo to another. Reply Bob Sundahl October 1, 2016 at 4:02 am I would like to add text to the photos Reply Bob Sundahl October 1, 2016 at 4:00 am I would like to add text as a comment on the content Reply Angel September 12, 2016 at 12:39 pm I recently discovered the editing features in this Photos app, despite having my laptop for just about a year. I am shocked...I love boosting the color. The only problem is I prefer doing the majority of my editing in other apps, so I usually bounce back and forth between Photos, Photoshop and various apps on my Note 5. It's a pain. Would love to know of another app that lets you selectively and easily boost the colors, as this app does. Meanwhile, good job Microsoft. I have never understood the hate of Windows 10. Reply Tom L. August 15, 2016 at 8:03 pm The photo editing in Windows 10 default Photos app has some nice tricks, but organizing photos by date alone is PATHETIC. In Windows Photo Gallery you have: a) naming and folder creation options at IMPORT which are quite powerful. NOTHING like this in PHOTOS. b) ability to assign comments, tags (like \"birds\" \"landscape\"), anything you like, AND renaming of files on the same window. NOT POSSIBLE in Photos. The good news / bad news for me -- I just bought a new DELL with Win 10 preinstalled, and with a little tweaking have my old Photo Gallery from the Win 7 machine working. Cool, that's the good. The bad -- the screen layout is reformatted, harder to read, AND I just tried to use the AUTO ADJUST button, and it's gone loco -- it whited out most of the image. Thank God the revert function still works. Reply Josef July 30, 2016 at 3:09 am I do not like the way Photos creates automatically Albums. They just pic a few pictures from folders. It doesn't make sense. I hope I can delete all automatically created albums. Having said that, I do like the albums, they look nice. I would like Photos to have the same functionality like OneDrive, where I can create Album from a folder by right clicking on it. I have 200 folders with 10,000 pictures, and creating albums picture by picture would take the rest of my life. Reply chris9465 July 29, 2016 at 12:35 pm How do you move photos out of the photo app? How do I see my photos on my hard drive? how do I mass delete all the dated folders I don't want need or asked for? how do we chose are own organization format? how do I stop the auto creation of dated files from my phone/camera to this app? These are the reasons photo app is an abomination. The answer to all of the above questions is: you can't. Reply sweet July 27, 2016 at 3:04 am I am so angry...before win 10 I could save my photo with edits using the windows photo editor, then at any point in the future, still be able to undo those changes. I thought win 10 was the same ...now my photo is f***'d...and I can't undo the changes....!@#$%^&*I(O I hate windows 10!!!!!!!!!!! not to mention it locks up...freezes everyday...twice on sunday!!!!!!!@#$%^&*()_ Reply Toober January 8, 2017 at 6:45 pm Dont be lukewarm, tell us how you REALLY feel about Windows, Sweet. Reply S. Tozzi July 23, 2016 at 10:27 am Windows 10 was installed without my permission! I can no longer open photos or scanned documents [ app din't start ]?! I can still use my printer but the \"scanning function\"is DEAD!?!!!? I had a system that worked. Now I have to go BEG or PAY somebody to solve a problem I didn't ask for. Thank you very much!!! Reply Apoettoo July 20, 2016 at 4:54 am It would be great if they would come out with a Windows 10 version of Photo Gallery. Photos does not do panoramas, which was a major wonderful thing about Photo Gallery. The Fine Tuning in Photo Gallery put all the editing features a click away. That made it easy to balance the light and color without opening and closing one feature or the other like in Photos. Why does Microsoft abandon good programs and come up with these sad replacements? Pity it is. Reply Joanne Khoury July 31, 2016 at 12:54 pm I miss the features in Photo Gallery that automatically saved a photo once I clicked on the next photo and allowed me to use all the filters (fine tuning) without having to click on each one. It's more time-consuming to have to click on Save for each photo and then select the filters each time. I also miss the Revert to Original feature and the Sharpness feature. When creating new programs, I do not understand why can't Microsoft create programs that keep all the features its users are used to and merely add new features. Reply Gerald July 6, 2016 at 6:41 pm It would be great if Microsoft could add XMP-tagging like Windows Live Photo Gallery had.... Reply Garp July 5, 2016 at 6:09 pm It could be nice if the Enhance function could be expanded to a batch function too. Reply Gina July 2, 2016 at 1:29 am I love how my photos look enhanced, but the save icons are not functional. Do you know how to fix that? Reply Sharon Mathiason June 1, 2016 at 10:45 pm All my photos were labelled by name and in named folders in Windows 7. Now, they just appear as images grouped by date. How do I get my original organization back? Reply chris9876 April 18, 2016 at 6:01 am This app destroyed my photo organization from windows 7. Now I have anywhere from 4-15 of the same photos and or folders destroying my hard drive space! Win10 is an abomination am done Mac Book here I come Reply Sherwin April 26, 2016 at 9:54 am Sorry to hear that, Chris. You could try installing the free program \"Ultimate Windows Tweaker 4 for Windows 10\". It's the only program I know of that lets you install Windows 7's \"Windows Photo Viewer\" on Windows 10 in just a few clicks. Reply Roger D Williams April 10, 2016 at 6:44 am Many of my photos are 360-degree panoramas, so I'd like the Photo App to be aware of this and give the LH and RH edges of my photos matching treatment. Reply Sherwin April 26, 2016 at 9:56 am That's a feature I'd like to see as well, Roger. Hope Microsoft will add it as part of a Windows Update. Reply Anonymous April 9, 2016 at 11:30 am I also used photos in my album to conveniently create a Sway project. I was amazed at the different editorial effects available.

Reply Chris April 7, 2018 at 2:21 pm Have only ever used Amazon Music Unlimited and am disappointed. I sense they are planning to discontinue the service in 2019. 1. Songs randomly become unavailable (without any sort of alert or unavailable list) so you have to manually comb through your playlists every now and again to replace them with different versions of the songs. This should either not happen or the service should do a replacement automatically. 2. They've stopped their upload feature and I've read that they will purge grandfathered content early 2019. For those like me that have rare MP3s not offered with their service and like to mix them in your playlists. 3. No smart playlists (for example having young kids, I manage a Clean List and an Explicit list and would like a Smart List to be the combination of both; similar to iTunes) 4. I understand they have only about a quarter of the selections as Spotify & others (~3M compared to ~12M) Perhaps the other services have these same problems. For those that know, please reply validating or nullifying if I should switch or stick with Amazon. Reply Pete June 30, 2018 at 11:13 am All music streaming services are subject to the random disappearance of songs. This is is actually beyond the control of the service provider. Typically this is caused by the publishers/artists and their respective contracts or decisions. Reply Chris September 21, 2018 at 2:23 pm Thanks for the comment Pete. Are you or anyone aware of any of the service that's smart enough to automatically replace with a working version? Reply Mr Shad December 2, 2018 at 11:28 am Fully agree Amazon deleting songs on my playlist is nonsense, my soul playlist had 30 songs deleted out of 100. Even for example the best of Bruce Springsteen was deleted as a new best of was released. I don t get that with other services and the range of music isn t that diverse.

Reply Mish January 26, 2018 at 10:17 pm I have been a Spotify fan and subscriber for years. It serves our multi-generation family perfectly. My individual membership still works for us. I have first priority, and the number two position rotates monthly to each of my two young-adult children. We each have a playlist folder with our name, therefore making it easier to find \"our\" songs and artists. Spotify is easily paired with home audio receivers, smart tv's, and of course, Alexa. I have no idea which music streaming company has the largest music catalogue, but we are as diverse as a family can be in our music preferances, and we are all happy with Spotify. Although I am a Amazon Prime member, I will stay with Spotify. \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\"! To each his own, multiple music streaming providers competing for customers serves each of us well in both financial savings, and genres of music offered. Reply michaelson of jack November 22, 2017 at 8:52 pm Amazon is for those who might enjoy music and think all music genres follow under \"POP\" as in popular. I don't recommend it for those who are musically inclined and love music. I have Prime and Unlimited music streaming [which is very slow] ... But fear I am missing my Jazz guitarists and independent songwriters that Spotify will give me; therefore I might switch in a few months from now. I am switching back to a apple computer soon too [from my surface], so i-tunes will help me find some downloadable songs. Reply Bangelica October 13, 2017 at 12:07 pm For those who wants to transfer their music playlist you might wanna try checking out musconv.com it helps transfer music playlist from one service to another - Bangelica Reply Mike September 16, 2017 at 2:04 pm I am bery happy with Spotify. I have used streaming on demand services for over a decade. I used to be with Rhapsody for many years. I switched to Spotify because of the great family plan that others have. They offer 320kbs playback which was highest than others when I signed up. As far as versatility, I have Alexa hooked into it and Bluetoothed to my hi quality Ediphiers. So with Spotify I can say \"Alexa play (song title)\" or \"Alexa play (particular playlist) from Spotify.\" It's integrated in my home theatre and my car obviously. I'm very happy with it but it's up to each person's desires to determine what's best for them. Just to emphasize Alexa is fully integrated with Alexa. Reply Mr. B August 19, 2017 at 6:44 pm I didnt see anything about fidelity here. Only Pandora offers improved fidleity with their payed service. My initial impressions of Amazon's basic Prime service was that the Sound quality was poor. More recently I haven't noticed that, so maybe they've improved it or maybe I just happen to be listening to better recorded source material. Reply Davthomp July 14, 2017 at 3:24 pm I started with Spotify, and loved it, and miss it. I had let my two teenage boys have access to it, but after far to many times while on a run, my playlist would get commandeered by one of them. The problem at the time was Spotify only had individual memberships, and Apple Music came out the the family plan. So I switched to the Apple Music Family plan as it was cheaper than three individual Spotify plans. Spotify finally offered a family plan, but we had all built up our playlists and didn't want to switch back again. What I miss about Spotify is finding new music. New music is dramatically easier to find on Spotify. Reply Ed Edwards May 21, 2017 at 6:53 pm Coming from paid Slacker account for close to two years, I wanted to stream line the whole family's music source. With two teens and a wife, we listen to music a lot. My preference is in finding new music artists in the various genres I listen to. Loved the 80 hair bands, but loved finding the undiscovered bands of that era more and continue to enjoy doing it. The kids are hip hop with some sprinklings of 80's pop-rock (journey, etc). I love the idea of banning a song or artist and never, ever, ever hearing them again on my phone. Since I am primarily in discovery mode, this is a nice luxury. The rest of the fam had Apple music as they all had Apple products. Fast forward to 2017 and we have 3 androids and one I Phone. Time to stop paying $19 for music and consolidate. I tried Spotify free, Amazon paid (1 month trial) and was going to commit to Amazon. I like the lyrics feature, the quick feedback customer service, and like most of the rest, the selection of music. After much browbeating from my lone Apple-ite and her informing me we can use Apple Music on Android, I decided to try that for a month and installed it on mine and my wife's phones. Needless to say, Apple on android is probably illegal in some countries and from my experience, it should be in all. Here's what I found wrong with Apple music for Android: 1. No landscape mode for app. In my car, using Google maps, my phone is in landscape 100% of the time. The Apple app sits in portrait the whole time forcing me to tilt my head to sometimes read the band I just \"discovered\". Want to read lyrics this way? Good luck. 2. Skip/dislike/thumbs down/etc: - It's a 3 step process. Click the 3 dots at bottom, then dislike the song and Apple will tell you they will try not to play stuff like this any more. A lie I'll address next. Unfortunately, you are still forced to listen to the song you already made pretty clear you dislike until you hit skip. 3. Didn't like that song on the \"created station\"? Well, stay tuned because it will show up again the next time you want to play that station again. Go to the dislike button and lo and behold, it's already selected red as if it knows you don't like this song. If you know I don't like it, why am I paying to hear it again? 4. Pause the song on a station to do another task (co-worker/gym rat/rob bank)? Or get out of your car and go inside and pick up where you left off? Nope. The song is gone, blank screen with play button that does nothing. You must exit/back out of the player to reselect the station and it starts a new song. In all fairness this is an App based issue and perhaps does not belong, but if any Android readers are here (I was), please consider these shortcomings before jumping in to Apple music. Reply Josh December 21, 2017 at 9:28 pm Agree, the Apple Music app on Android is awful. Totally different than on iPhone. Slacker however has been my favorite for close to 10 years. Since back when they had their own hardware. I have written them several times saying I will leave Apple Music in a heartbeat if they'd offer a family plan, but they don't and it's a shame. Reply Alex March 29, 2017 at 2:16 am Wow people, the article's title is pretty clear as to what services is comparing. It doesn't say \"review of all paid music streaming services\" great that you like google, then write an article about it! Thanks for this article, it was VERY informative! Reply buzz April 19, 2017 at 7:43 pm Agreed. I was going to point that out but you beat me to it. Reply Lee Malone January 19, 2019 at 5:52 pm That is the problem though, it should compare all services to be believed. Otherwise it might seem like shilling for one or all of the few compared. Personally, I think Soundcloud is the best, and at least on par with those reviewed here. Reply Brian Sandridge February 9, 2017 at 1:05 am Why does Amazon Music play louder and w better sound than Apple Music? Reply Ender February 2, 2017 at 4:57 pm Google Music is the best in my opinion. Best interface / apps, best prediction / discovery, allows uploading personal collection to cloud for streaming from any device, bundled YouTube Red + YouTube Music, pays artists the most, etc.. Reply Bryan Wolfe January 28, 2017 at 3:42 pm We'll definitely examine Google Music at a later day. Thanks to the awesome comments. Reply David Styles January 18, 2017 at 11:31 am Amazon Prime Unlimited because as well as the same as all the others you can additionally use your voice via the Amazon Echo devices to play music, much faster than typing and you don't need a phone, tablet or P.C. On to use it. Use an Echo Dot and Bluetooth link it to good hi fi speakers via an aptx dongle or active speakers and the system is unbeatable. Finally pay an annual fee and it is far cheaper than all the other services. Reply Tom January 12, 2017 at 10:34 pm Like so many others have pointed-out, I'm shocked you intentionally omitted Google Play Music. While none of the services are perfect, GPM has been the best for me, and I've been a (paid) subscriber for years. I dumped Spotify when they couldn't get their act together with radio. I could be listening to jazz for an hour, and they'd suddenly give me a rap song... Hours into Beethoven & Bach, and they'd randomly inject hip-hop. Google seems to really have their act together when it comes to understanding my likes, and moods, and they figured-out (the first few days) that I'm not into rap or hip-hop -- something that seems to confound Spotify. Add to that the fact I can upload up-to 50,000 of my own tracks, and listen anywhere, on a ny device (it's completely platform-agnostic) and the service is a no-brainer. Reply likefunbutnot January 12, 2017 at 10:15 pm My problem with more or less all streaming services is the incredibly poor way they handle classical music. The services themselves have incorrect meta-data or use non-uniform sources, so it's very common to find albums or tracks misidentified because the services don't discriminate between the \"Artist\", \"Album Artist\" and \"Composer\" information, or because there's no official album title or a title that's entirely duplicated like \"Herbert von Karajon Conducts Beethoven's 9th Symphony\" (classical albums are really more accurately discussed by their publisher's catalog number; what we computer people like to call a \"primary key\") and every music database calls it something different. This is endlessly aggravating and renders more or less all mainstream streaming music services useless. It's also not going to be fixed, because the people who run the services and the databases they rely on don't give a shit what classical music people want. Services that cater to classical music fans on the other hand are incredibly expensive and will pretty much never have the support of mainstream devices, so we're left with our nerd options of maintaining a giant, self-organized library as a solitary pursuit or just giving up and accepting that everything sucks and is wrong. Reply Kobela January 23, 2017 at 6:17 am Wow, I had this same argument in my DBA class, mainly regarding building a database that included artists cover songs. We never did decide the right way to build it, so I ended up conceding my points since it was just a class project. Reply qanik April 27, 2017 at 6:21 am agree 100% and even more so - so what service do you find that is tolerable Reply likefunbutnot April 27, 2017 at 3:38 pm @Qanik, At one time, I was paying the $300/year charged for the Naxos Music Library. That's insanely expensive compared to other services, but it also worked vastly better than things like Play Music. At the moment, I use Amazon and very deliberately avoid using it for classical music, choosing jazz or movie soundtracks instead since those things are not typically mislabeled by Amazon's database. I hope that one of the services will get better and I can say that Amazon has at least given me better and more useful feedback about my complaints than I got from Google. Reply Dan Fein January 12, 2017 at 8:41 pm It's about time Spotify will fix their shuffle play. It doesn't really shuffle your Playlist. Spotify neglects hundreds of requests to fix it in their support forum. This is very disturbing. Reply Erin January 12, 2017 at 8:29 pm I also use Google Play Music. I enjoy it a lot, especially since it also comes with YouTube Red. I also have tons of my own music uploaded to Google. I used the free version for a long while, but I got tired of the ads. Google Play Music also has a free 90-day trial. I'll be honest, I had every intention of cancelling after the free trial, but the lack of ads on Google Play Music and YouTube convinced me to pay for it. Plus, I like to listen to the music through my Chromecast. Reply Dimitri January 12, 2017 at 12:17 pm You should mention that either Apple or Amazon doesn't support Chromecast, and it's a deal breaker for me. I personally use the new Napster app from Rhapsody and it's fantastic. Same 9.99$ Reply Mediamark January 12, 2017 at 4:31 am I recently stumbled upon Amazon Prime Music and so far am enjoying it. I had been using Pandora, which is blocked by my new employer's security settings. Reply REINC October 10, 2017 at 9:43 pm Get a VPN and then you don't have to worry about your employers security settings.

Fantastic selection, high quality sound and terrific playlist recommendations. No reason to switch. Reply SpotifyAndAppleMusic July 14, 2017 at 2:44 am I am a spotify premium member forever too! And I have Apple Music.... ? Reply Ghazaros January 11, 2017 at 10:36 pm Get your facts right: apple music does have an android app, it just sucks. Reply kringler January 11, 2017 at 7:52 pm I'm still shocked that Google Play Music isn't included in the article. It comes with YouTube Red, which is a nice bonus, is essentially the same price, has a free, nifty 3rd party desktop app, has a music selection that doesn't seem far off from Spotify, and I greatly, greatly enjoy it's playlists far more than Spotify's. I tried Amazon's since I have Prime, but the whole user experience is truly dreadful. Reply Matt Mauer January 11, 2017 at 7:20 pm Best one = Google Play music Reasoning: It does what the other ones do (all are roughly equal) but also has youtube red. How did this service get missed??

Reply Frank January 11, 2017 at 6:05 pm In Germany Spotify lists Rammstein. Not to be found on Amazon. Reply Davin Peterson January 11, 2017 at 4:46 pm Hey, what about Google Play Music, which existed before Apple Music and can do the same things Apple Music can? Reply Gary January 11, 2017 at 4:29 pm Since I have Prime I started using the basic Amazon music. Previously used Pandora and podcasts. I switched to the new Amazon music unlimited recently when they were offering the $20 credit and free month. Get a lot more music that I could not get before. I prefer to download all to my SD card rather than stream. This way, my entire family(up to 10 devices) can use the service, since only one device is allowed to stream at a time. Is this the best service? Maybe, maybe not. It suits my needs and I already have it included anyhow and the extra $70? per year for more music isn't a big hit.

I have a new wind8.1 computer and decided to take advantage of the 1TB of storage on onedrive and so moved all my photos and videos to onedrive. though it seems it can't upload files which are too big. i realised we don't have enough data on our internet plan to upload them all anyway, so i want to stop this sync. There are over 2 thousand files (photos and videos) which are still showing in the uploads folder (where it lists Actions in Progress), but it doesn't seem to give me any options to resume or remove them from syncing, or delete, or any other options for that matter. it just states \"uploading - 0% complete\". i would like to discontinue the upload. thanks in advance if anyone can help. Reply Tina April 6, 2015 at 7:14 pm Becca, in Windows 8.1 you can disable OneDrive sync. This page describes it very well: How to Completely Disable OneDrive Reply Patricia April 1, 2015 at 7:32 pm Thank you for the article. I learned more today than many trips to ask questions. :) Can you please tell me how to set sync on a timer so it only happens between midnight and 4 am? I am using a new internet provider and have a limit on data. free time is that window. THANKS Reply Tina April 2, 2015 at 9:35 am Glad you found this article useful, Patricia. AFAIK, OneDrive currently doesn't offer a timed sync feature. However, OneDrive will only sync, when the app is running. I would suggest to not run the app, unless you want it to sync. Go into OneDrive settings (right-click icon in notifications area / system tray), in the Settings tab remove the checkmark for \"Start OneDrive automatically when I sign in to Windows\". That way, OneDrive won't be able to sync, unless you start the app. Then use Windows Task Scheduler to set up a scheduled task to launch OneDrive at midnight every day. Your computer needs to be turned on for this to work. Alternatively, you could schedule your computer to boot just before OneDrive is supposed to run.

Reply Tim February 6, 2015 at 3:09 am Windows 8.1 is the worst thing to happen to computing since Vista. Clunky, badly laid out, slow and user hostile. An absolute disaster. OneDrive has slowed my computer down to the point that it's embarrassing to be with clients. With Windows 7 and SkyDrive everything worked brilliantly - so why go and wreck it? Is there anyway that I can sync at the end of a session instead of waiting 5 - 10 minutes for files to sync the whole time? Thanks Reply david January 30, 2015 at 10:02 am the most annoying thing about one drive is that i can't go through and delete the photos that i don't want, without them automatically re-syncing from my phone. so any bad pictures i take, which is the majority of them, i have to delete twice Reply Octo Podi July 19, 2017 at 2:38 am Yep, in July '17 that still seems to be the case. :( Reply Roman January 28, 2015 at 3:07 pm I would rather see an option so that I can save the files locally first, and then sync them to the cloud second. That way I everything would be local for quick access (like we are all used to prior to the cloud). And if I could do this, we would need this enormously giant officefilecache folder that apparently holds a second copy (among other things) of the files that I already have on my computer. To be clear: I don't really want to work from the cloud; I just want to use the cloud as my backup.

Reply JohnB August 24, 2014 at 1:12 pm Of all my systems OneDrive works best on an old Windows 7 system. Under Windows 8.1 OneDrive reloads at least once a day. Further, the assumption by Microsoft that I want all cloud folders visible on a local system is flawed - under Windows 7 I make the decision which folders are visible locally - I have archive folders that I don't want visible locally and that are relatively large that I don't want to allocate space locally (even if they are only \"smart folders\" they do take up space) - let me manage my systems! Reply antman May 27, 2014 at 12:28 am Thank you sexy. These are some great pointers. Like someone else said, I wish to use Onedrive modern app without linking my MS account to Windows 8. Microsoft needs to change this behavior. Reply Dale May 26, 2014 at 1:27 pm My biggest gripe with OneDrive is the requirement to be logged in to a specific account on my 8.1 laptop, in order to access OneDrive. If there is a way to use OneDrive like other cloud storage systems, via login credential on a webpage, I'd be eager to hear about that. Reply Ian May 23, 2014 at 11:56 pm Some great tips and info here but one point I want to question, Have you actually tried to delete the original folder location? even with admin rights will full permission? I tried then ran the net user command prompt and tried again and failed, as you later commented that the drive was an integral part of the O/S you failed to comprehend that admin rights over any file is a variable the UAC controls the level of of privilege that is not continuous, disabling the prompts won't help either. Small point. live with the security and ignore the folder! Reply Tina S May 24, 2014 at 9:38 am Thank you for your comment, Ian. I did delete the original folder after moving OneDrive to its new location as described above. I just checked again and the OneDrive folder is no longer there. This was on Windows 8.1 with the most recent updates installed and OneDrive moved to a second partition.

Reply android underground February 9, 2013 at 2:20 pm Pingponging files through the cloud is nice and easy, but all cloud services want you to install their own app that connects to one cloud account on one cloud service only. If you don't want a homescreen full of apps for all your cloud services just use a file manager to fit 'em all in one app. My current favourite is ES FileExplorer, which talks with all my dropbox/skydrive/box.net/sugarsync/gdrive accounts. It has an ftp client and server too, and it dances samba. Reply samol February 9, 2013 at 2:00 pm One more way is to use ES File Explorer in Android to download files from a \"Windows Shared Folder'. Check out Chris Hoffman's article about ES File Explorer dated Jan 9, 2013. For some reason I can't paste the link. Here's how I just did a transfer. -open ES. -in top left hand corner select Local then Lan -select the NEW+ button then Scan (you can click the screen to stop it once your network data appears) -select your network/windows shared folder -find the file you want t transfer and select copy -in top left corner again select lan/local select the folder you want to copy to, then select paste. You should see the a copy icon at the bottom of the page. Click on the icon to see the file being copied. You can see the download progress in the Android taskbar. This also works with my wdtv box to download a movie or whatever. Of course you can just stream the movie to watch it anyway. Reply Ryan Dube February 9, 2013 at 10:07 pm Awesome - thanks for the great tip Samol. ES File Explorer is a great solution as well, I agree. Reply arkhadius February 9, 2013 at 11:14 am I used to use dropbox but it was laggy. Then I started using TeamVIewer for transfering files between devices, you forgot about this one :) But that Wi-Fi explorer seems nice, I'll check it. Thanks :) Reply Slashee the Cow February 9, 2013 at 1:30 am In the first screenshot, you say to tap on the \"USB debugging connected\" notification - that's wrong, tapping that will just take you to the debugging options, which most people who aren't developers won't be interested in - and won't have on in the first place, so that notification won't appear for most people. It is possible to transfer files over a debugging connection, but only by pushing them through adb, which requires the Android SDK. You just want to tap on the notification that says \"USB connected\" (which might be different depending on the ROM). Also, not all phones (or to be more specific, ROMs) will mount as a USB mass storage device, some (from memory I think it's at least Samsung devices running TouchWiz) will only mount as an MTP device - you should still be able to transfer files using Windows Explorer though. Reply Ryan Dube February 9, 2013 at 1:35 am That's a really good point - on my phone (my ROM) it allows a toggle between debugging and mass storage, but you make an excellent point that making the mount as USB can be different by ROM (or nonexistent for some), so that is important to keep in mind. Thank you for the clarification. Reply Stephen Mitchell February 8, 2013 at 10:23 pm Any idea how to get a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 to appear as USB Mass Storage? I have USB debugging enabled, but the phone still only gives the options of connecting via MTP or PTP. Reply Ryan Dube February 8, 2013 at 10:45 pm Have you tried toggling USB debugging while it's connected to the PC to see what it does? At some point the computer should pick up on the device as a connected USB storage device. If you still have issues, you might try asking about in the Answers section of this site to see if anyone else with a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 has done this. Reply Stephen Mitchell February 9, 2013 at 9:29 pm I've tried toggling USB debugging with the phone connected. I see a dialogue asking me whether to turn on debugging, but nothing else happens. As per Slashee the Cow's comment below, I think that my phone simply doesn't support USB Mass Storage mode. It will connect as an MTP device, but as I'm using Debian which doesn't support MTP very well this isn't especially useful. On a more positive note, I've set up an FTP server by following your instructions. This isn't ideal since I don't know of any media players that sync over FTP, but at least it gives me a reliable way to move files to and from my phone by hand which I haven't been able to do since I switched from Windows to Debian several weeks ago. Reply Ryan Dube February 9, 2013 at 10:08 pm Awesome - glad to hear the FTP server solution worked. I actually use the FTP solution often mostly because I've always liked using FTP commands, not so much out of convenience. Glad you found a solution that worked for you. Anonymous February 12, 2013 at 7:27 pm Supposedly, USB Mass Storage goes away with Jelly Bean, if not already with ICS. This is a major bummer as I used robocopy to mass transfer and verify stuff from the phone to the PC.

Reply Greg February 12, 2013 at 10:29 pm I had some issues until I used the stock cable that came with my phone, rather than a Motorola cable I had laying around by my computer. I thought I had USB debugging turned on, but it's off now and I just transferred files recently (sorry, not near a computer to test this).

Reply TorchingIgloosdotcom February 9, 2013 at 12:33 am I agree, I use this almost daily. If you're rooted and using Wi-FI it's simple to setup, and a MUST HAVE! No cords FTW!

Who writes this click-bait crap. Seriously, it is only a small segment of the Google version of Android that is exposed (and there are a number of simple temporary fixes). It does not affect phones from Samsung and other manufacturers. Any chance someone could do a little homework before spouting off like Donald Trump. Reply Anonymous September 17, 2015 at 10:55 pm Now this is the article you could have written... http://www.wired.com/2015/09/hack-brief-new-emergency-number-hack-easily-bypasses-android-lock-screens/ \"The issue is limited to phones that use a password rather than a PIN or pattern. That s a small fraction of the millions of potentially vulnerable devices.\" or this one... http://www.androidheadlines.com/2015/09/bug-leaves-android-5-x-vulnerable-password-lock-screen-hack.html So rather than creating inappropriate potential hysteria, you could get your facts straight and actually provide some useful information.

I'll say what I want, when I want, any way I want. The article is incomplete and misleading. That's sloppy, click bait induced, journalism (and I use the term journalism loosely here). I don't have to (and won't) justify my response to you but thanks for letting me know at least one person read it. Good luck with detox. Reply Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 9:18 pm Cant up zero meds ;), plus your welcome on reading the comment, however here at makeuseof is seems more like these are articles written by people who just want to write and hope it helps someone. And you could use any article and say it is incomplete and misleading because usually people don't have all of the details or they might seem to be missing a couple of key things, thats why there is a link that goes to another article talking about ios 9 and all of its updates. Click Bait is not really what I would use for this article. It is however a good article that is quite useful and seems to be simple enough for an average person to read. Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 10:02 pm Again, you miss the point. Stating \"Your Android Password Is Useless \" is factually incorrect. Its highly emotional wording intent on drawing people into the article (based on FUD). Also, stating the Android has a password issue then spending the majority of the article on the benefits of iOS9 seems equally questionable. If I am an Android user, why would I care about anything iOS? No matter how you try and skew it, this is possibly the worst thought out article in MakeUseOfHistory. Don't get me wrong, I follow/read/enjoy MakeUseOf but I'll call a spade a spade regardless of who writes/posts it. Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 10:16 pm you should care about the fact that your android has a few security troubles that he tells you what they are. Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 10:26 pm I am experienced enough with IT (20+ yrs) to have already known about the issue. My concern is for the variety of less experienced people that come here (and those I have recommended this site to previously). Fact: It was poorly done, misleading and played on FUD I have come to expect better from MakeUseOf as a source. Dave Parrack September 18, 2015 at 10:32 pm Please read the actual section of the article you have an issue with (not the headline), and tell me what the problem is? I have told the truth, which is that a bug in Android 5.0 was discovered which allowed people to bypass password lock screens, informed readers what Google is doing about it, and then offered some advice, namely to switch to using a pattern or PIN until the issue is fixed. I stand by that as a solid tree paragraphs of informative reporting. Dave Parrack September 18, 2015 at 10:28 pm It's always nice to meet a fan! All I can advise is for you to either avoid Tech News Digest or even all articles written by me, but please don't abandon MakeUseOf because you disagree with one headline of one article written as part of a daily column. Dave Parrack September 18, 2015 at 10:26 pm Thanks for your support, Alex. The point of this article, and every edition of Tech News Digest, is to provide a brief overview of the current tech news, and I think we do it well. As you say, it's written for the average user, not someone who is already so technically minded that they have probably already seen all of this news reported elsewhere. Dave Parrack September 18, 2015 at 10:24 pm John, you're entitled to your view, but as the author of this article I disagree with your assessment. There's a huge difference between clickbait and an engrossing headline. Sure, I could have written a long headline such as \"Some Android Passwords on Certain Handsets Can Be Bypassed By Typing In a Long String of Characters\" but it would be wholly unnecessary. This headline tells you that there's a problem with Android passwords, and if you want to know more you should probably read the whole article. You have also taken issue with this article also talking about iOS 9. This is daily news digest, and as such it covers multiple news stories. One was the Android password problem, and another entirely different story was the launch of iOS 9. I don't know if you noticed but there are four other stories in there too. Our Security section may address the Android password issue in greater detail in the coming days, but that is not what this column does. Reply Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 10:33 pm Don't make it worse by being ridiculous. No editor worth his snuff would have allowed such a headline to begin with. That said, \"Android exploit, Is your device Affected\" or \"Some Android devices exposed by bug\" or something like that would have been far more accurate/appropriate. My apologies for the misquote, I was responding to the previous posters comment \"...because usually people don t have all of the details or they might seem to be missing a couple of key things, thats why there is a link that goes to another article talking about ios 9 and all of its updates.\" I stand by my assertion of Click bait however. You can fiddle with the semantics all you want but the \"urgency\" associated with \"Android Passwords Are Rendered Useless\" is far higher than something like \"Android exploit, Is your device Affected\" Reply Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 10:47 pm Well I am now opting out of this comment thread, I understand your point of view John I just choose not to accept it Anonymous September 17, 2015 at 4:26 pm Don't mean to seem like a clod here but did you really mean to refer to the Washington Post as an \"esteemed organ\"? Reply Anonymous September 17, 2015 at 5:45 pm @Sahate Ubiol, Organ is a valid but seldom used English-language synonym for newspaper or communiqu . I'd say there's usually a mildly negative connotation, since it's often indicate a source of bias, e.g. \"Pravda is the organ for the Russian Communist party.\" Reply Dave Parrack September 18, 2015 at 10:17 pm Oh yes, that was intended. I see now that it may be very British, and therefore not the best line to use on MakeUseOf, but it is at least proper English, as likefun butnot said :) Reply Anonymous September 17, 2015 at 1:26 pm Dave, you forgot to discuss the only feature of iOS 9 that is actually important: Proper letter case on the on-screen keyboard. I might even dig my iphone out from under my desk and take the time to update it, just so I can see it in person.

Once you've opened Northwind, choose the Create tab on the Microsoft Office ribbon. In the Reports selection, you ll see a number of methods that Access supports for creating a report. If you'd like, feel free to click on a few of these and get a feel for what reports look like and the various types of information that they contain. Create a new report. After you've satisfied your curiosity, go ahead and click on Report Wizard and we'll begin the process of creating a report. The wizard will walk us through the creation process step-by-step. After you've mastered the wizard, you might want to return to this step and explore the flexibility provided by the other creation methods. Choose a table or query. The first screen of the Report Wizard asks us to choose the source of data for our report. If you want to retrieve information from a single table, you can select it from the drop-down box below. Alternatively, for more complex reports, we can choose to base our report on the output of a query that we previously designed. For our example, all of the data we need is contained within the Employees table, so choose Table > Employees from the drop-down menu. Select the fields to include. Notice that after you select the table from the drop-down menu, the bottom section of the screen changes to show the fields available in that table. Use the > button to move the fields you would like to include in your report to the Selected Fields section. Note that the order you place the fields in the right column determines the default order they will appear in your report. Remember that we're creating an employee telephone directory for our senior management. Let's keep the information contained in it simple the first and last name of each employee, their title, and their home telephone number. Go ahead and select these fields. When you are satisfied, click the Next button. Select the grouping levels. At this stage, you can select one or more grouping levels to refine the order in which our report data is presented. For example, we may wish to break down our telephone directory by department so that all of the members of each department are listed separately. However, due to the small number of employees in our database, this is not necessary for our report. Go ahead and simply click on the Next button to bypass this step. You may wish to return here later and experiment with grouping levels. Choose your sorting options. In order to make reports useful, we often want to sort the results by one or more attributes. In the case of our telephone directory, the logical choice is to sort by the last name of each employee in ascending (A to Z) order. Select this attribute from the first drop-down box and then click the Next button to continue. Choose the formatting options. In the next screen, we re presented with some formatting options. We ll accept the default tabular layout but let s change the page orientation to landscape to ensure the data fits properly on the page. Once you ve completed this, click the Next button to continue. Add the title. Finally, we need to give the report a title. Access will automatically provide a nicely formatted title at the top of the screen, with the appearance shown in the report style you selected during the previous step. Let s call our report Employee Home Phone List. Make sure that the Preview the report option is selected and click Finish to see our report!", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/create-reports-with-microsoft-access-2010-1019888?utm_source=emailshare&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons", "index": 0}

I like to test different home screens because I am not one to stay consistent at times, yet I have found that I always go back to the Free Go Launcher EX and some of the additional Widgets that work with it.

Minimalist but very nice. I wish it had widget support for the free version. Reply Joel Lee August 10, 2013 at 2:33 am Thanks! I love minimalism and Smart Launcher looks superb. Going to look more into it! Reply Rajendra August 7, 2013 at 4:59 am MIhome launcher for iPhone style is also worthy ... Reply Nohl L August 7, 2013 at 4:00 am I am a little surprised that Buzz Launcher was not listed. It's pretty versatile; coordinates with a number of popular widgets; and it lets you share your best ideas with thousands of other people worldwide. Reply Joel Lee August 10, 2013 at 2:32 am Never heard of Buzz Launcher but it looks real nice. Thanks! Reply Paul in NJ August 7, 2013 at 3:04 am Presumably these work on Android tablets too... Reply Joel Lee August 10, 2013 at 2:31 am Most of them should, but I would double check on the app page before installing any of them! Reply Rajaa C August 7, 2013 at 1:08 am I use a Samsung Galxy Chat GT-B5330 and few months ago received the JB 4.1.2 official update. However, the whole experience was getting killed by the Samsung touchwiz interface. That is when I hecided that I would really appreciate the stock Android interface experience and switched to Holo Launcher HD free version, and till date never regretted my decision. It is fast and snappy and is a beautiful launcher. Reply Rick August 7, 2013 at 3:58 am I use Holo as well, albeit the pro version, with the standard Holo on my old Froyo phone and the HD on my newer Jellybean. I agree. Awesome launcher! Lightweight, fast and snappy, yet feature filled. Reply Vipul J August 7, 2013 at 5:49 am +1 to Holo Launcher HD. Basically it's pretty similar to Apex & Nova but because of one feature I stick to Holo. I can assign swipe up or down as a gesture to open recent apps which usually works by long pressing my Home key on my SGS2 I9100. So its kind of saving my button's life! Nova & Apex have gestures too but none have the option of assigning recent apps in it. Reply Anonymous Droider August 7, 2013 at 8:14 am As for Apex, tap Menu > Apex settings > Behavior Settings > Under Gestures, select whichever gesture you want, (for ex, in your case, swipe up/down) and assign Recent apps to it. Mostly Nova will have a way of doing the same as well. Reply Vipul J August 8, 2013 at 10:20 am Apex was the first launcher I tried on my S2 and it did have gestures but not recent apps to assign. Anonymous Droider August 8, 2013 at 10:34 am At the time of posting my comment, I manually set the swipe up gesture to \"Recent Apps\" in the way as mentioned in my comment. I was using the latest version, i.e. Apex Launcher Pro v2.0.6 At present I'm using Nova Launcher Prime v2.2 And the steps are as follows Menu > Nova Settings > Gestures and Buttons > Swipe Up / Swipe Down > Recent apps (The list of assignable actions is scrollable in both launchers) Vipul J August 8, 2013 at 10:52 am In that case, thanks I'll check them. I always tried the free ones and found it only in Holo HD free. I guess pro versions would have that feature. Anonymous Droider August 8, 2013 at 10:59 am Cheers. I'm sure Googling the name + version of the pro versions will point you to the right direction. Joel Lee August 10, 2013 at 2:30 am Holo is definitely a great one. Thanks for sharing!

Mac (Chrome): Use the three-dotted menu at the top-right corner to find More Tools > Developer Tools , or hit the Command+Option+I (uppercase \"i\") hotkey. Mac (Firefox): From the menu button in the upper-right corner of the screen, navigate to Web Developer > Inspector , or open it with your keyboard via Command+Option+C . Change the user agent of your web browser so that you can trick YouTube into thinking that you're accessing the video from a mobile browser. This is the only way to make sure the video is actually downloadable. Chrome: From the very top-right corner of developer tools, right next to the x button, is another dotted menu button. Use that to open More tools > Network conditions . Uncheck Select automatically , and choose Firefox - iPhone . Firefox: From a new tab, in the address bar, enter about:config and confirm the \"risk\" message (if you see it). In the search box that appears, search for general.useragent.override .

The page should change a bit and the video will fill nearly the whole screen. If Firefox or Chrome automatically redirects you back to the desktop page, select the link that says to return to the mobile version of YouTube. Start the video, again, keeping the developer tools window open. Pause it after it's been playing for a few seconds. From the developer tools window, locate the small mouse pointer icon it lets you choose which element to inspect on the page. It should be at the very top-left corner of the window. With that tool enabled, select the video. Back in the developer tools window, look for a section that includes a really long URL. It begins with the text src=\"https:// and is probably blue, and may even be highlighted already. After some random characters should be what reads .googlevideo.com/videoplayback . Don't see this link? Open the Network tab of the developer tools menu and select the videoplayback entry to find the link off to the right in the Headers section. Double-click, double-tap, or manually select the URL to highlight it, and then copy the link by right-clicking or tapping-and-holding the text and picking the copy option. You can also use your keyboard: Ctrl+C in Windows or Command+C in macOS. Open a new tab in Chrome or Firefox and paste that URL into the address bar, and then press Enter to open it. The whole page should look different than YouTube's normal website but the video should start playing normally. Depending on how it was copied, there might be some unnecessary text at the beginning and end and the video that prevents it from opening. If the page doesn't load, erase src=\" from the beginning and \" from the end so that the URL starts with https:// and ends with a letter or number (not a quotation mark). Right right-click or tap-and-hold the video, choose the save option, and pick somewhere on your computer to save it to.

Make sure that the court clerk has your updated and accurate mailing address so that you can receive the notice. [1] As your case gets underway, you can keep track of your upcoming court hearings by writing them down in a journal that you keep specifically for your case. Image titled Find a Court Hearing Date Step 2.png 2 Ask the other party. If you are in a pinch and need to find the court date because you think it is approaching, then call the other party to the litigation (or her attorney) and ask when the hearing is scheduled. Your opponent will gain no tactical advantage by having you miss the court hearing, so they should tell you. If you miss a hearing, then the judge can technically decide an issue against you. For example, if you are the plaintiff of a lawsuit, then the judge may dismiss your case. Nevertheless, the judge will not look kindly on your opponent if he or she refused to tell you the hearing date. You can explain to the court why you missed the hearing. If you have a good reason, then the judge will allow you to refile the case or vacate any default judgment against you. Image titled Find a Court Hearing Date Step 3.png 3 Call the court clerk. You can call the court clerk and ask when your hearing is scheduled. [2] The clerk s phone number should be available in the phone book or by searching online. Have the following information available to give to the clerk: the case number the name of the other party the judge you appear in front of Image titled Find a Court Hearing Date Step 4.png 4 Use an online system. Your court may have an online system that you can use. For example, the District Court in Spokane County, Washington uses an online system that you can search. [3] At the website, you can search for a court date by case number. Click on the District Court Case Info & Court Hearings tab. Then select Court Dates by Case Number from the drop-down options. You can also search by party name. Enter the case number or party name and click Go. To see if your court has an online system, search court date lookup and then the name of the court.

I did like the Blackberry 9800 its Camera and excellent photos were something I will always remember fondly! Blackberry server enterprise and Besx were also superb to administer! Most secure handsets as well great privacy! Reply James December 22, 2016 at 11:09 pm My BB Passport is the best phone I've owned. It looks great. The keyboard is superb. Its design is just beautiful - it always attracts favourable attention whenever people see it. The OS is slick and the whole system operates smoothly when running software designed for BB10. Android- based stuff can run OK, but not everything does and, if it does, it doesn't always work smoothly. Hacks can get the Google family of Play Store apps running but there are problems getting updates. And it is here that BB has failed - apps. No one is now developing BB 10 apps. Windows may well be going the same way. The future seems to belong to IOS and Android. Something about Blackberry keeps me hoping they might survive and prosper, but then I remember the shameful abandonment of loyal Playbook users and a part of me thinks they deserve commercial obliteration. Reply Shawn A December 21, 2016 at 4:12 pm I still think my old Blackberry was the greatest phone I ever had. The reception was terrific, the call quality was great, the OS was a bit clunky and hard to use for a first timer, but once you got to know all the ins and outs, it was fantastic, and pretty power user friendly just due to all the advanced settings you could change. The OS was very stable and never crashed. The best part? The battery life would last 3 days with heavy use. My iPhone 6S is down to 40% by the time I get home from work at the end of the day! My Android phone was even worse than that! Reply Falconwign17 December 22, 2016 at 4:51 pm What was your Android phone? Reply Shawn A December 22, 2016 at 4:53 pm I had a Galaxy S4 before my iPhone 6S Reply Shawn December 19, 2016 at 10:46 pm BlackBerry devices will be here to stay. Just because someone else produces the hardware, (that BlackBerry will also oversee) the software and security is all BlackBerry. From the root of trust, to the beautiful BlackBerry Hub. It's really no different then other companies who rely on China to produce the device. I wish this site would get the facts correct. Reply Dwayne December 19, 2016 at 12:37 pm Have always loved blackberry since my BlackBerry flip phone. Sorry to see them go. Just purchased the BlackBerry dtek60 and I love it. Reply Ebs December 19, 2016 at 1:57 pm BlackBerry won't go anywhere. This article is sadly another haters product or just a click-bait mash up. BlackBerry just licensed the right to build Smartphones to TCL and an Indonesian manufacturer, while those two companies still have to work closely with BlackBerry together in terms of e.g. the hardware root of trust. So next BlackBerries will still strongly be influenced by Waterloo. iPhones are being fully manufactured by (chinese) Foxconn over maybe a decade now. Does anyone care?? BlackBerry clearly outsourced the hardware production to Asia to lower financial risks like all the other big IT-companies of the Western world.

I work for the State of New York and they have given me an I-Phone. In comparison, my personal BlackBerry I bettter! Reply Doyle L. Wynn Jr. December 18, 2016 at 10:32 pm I have a BB10 Passport, I everything about this device, EVERYTHING!!! I recently switched carriers From ATT Business to T-Mobile. During the number porting I find out that the Device is still lock by ATT. The Tech Rep was helping me unlock my Passport with the codes he had. You only get 10 attempts then the phone is permently lock. Guess what, the phone is locked and can't be unlocked!!! I love this phone so much I'm going to Purchase the Silver Edition. I really wish Blackberry would have stayed in the game. I Hate Virtual keypad's and as good as voice to text works really well, I just feel weird talk to my phone. I tried the Private but the Keyboard was to small, like the tourch. RIP to an Awesome era of the BB10 physical keyboards. Reply Weegens coty December 18, 2016 at 5:47 pm Yes I've been an owner of Blackberry for 13 years, and I bought most of them that came out. I still owned the passport, priv and now the dtek60. It's very fluid, sexy and beautiful. I love it very well Reply Patrick Weaver December 18, 2016 at 4:23 pm I have a Blackberry Curve, through work, and have turned down the opportunity to exchange it for an iPhone. I realise it is obsolete BUT its keyboard means it is perfect for sending texts and emails. I have a Google Nexus 7 of my own for accessing the net, as the Curve is useless for that. I have NO intention of switching from, or exchanging, my Curve. I will take it to my grave, unless I can be persuaded that Apple phones and their predictive text are any better. Reply Tony December 18, 2016 at 2:56 pm I still own and use two BB10 devices: the Classic and Passport. There is no intention to buy an Android or iOS device anytime in the foreseeable future. My BB10 devices do everything I need it to do. These phones can probably last me another 20 years if necessary. I've had previous BlackBerry devices that lasted me 5-10 years. No need to change getting into ridiculous cycles of 'cool phones, big debt, no purpose'. Why should people be upgrading their phones each time a manufacture tells you to? Who wins? People are simply slaves to the phone game. Reply steve power December 18, 2016 at 1:42 pm Simply the ease of blackberry Hub, and pdf opening so easily ...running a priv at moment not sure to go go for dtek 60 or pixel Best phone BlackBerry ever made was passport ,unbelievable battery length ease of use and grateful display ,but ran bb10 a operating system 2 years too late . Priv is a great phone but at launched with a ridiculous price tag against Samsung s6 and BlackBerry wondered why it wasn't successful. All in a sad state of affairs blackberry hang your head in shame ,I feel sorry for the designers and app developers ,but hold the marketing and CEO to blame Reply Mohit soni india December 18, 2016 at 12:39 pm No i need the blackberry to make device Bcoz its the safest hand we can get Reply Pete December 18, 2016 at 12:27 pm I love my BlackBerry Priv it's does everything an android does with a hard keyboard not taking any of the screen. It's a pity Blackberry came to android market a bit too late Reply Wade December 22, 2016 at 2:48 pm Yeah they really wanted too long. If they would have taken the Android route sooner I think they would be a lot more relevant today. I own the Priv and liked it but unfortunately it stopped taking a charge and now won't turn on. Reply blackberry forever December 18, 2016 at 11:57 am yes I use blackberry allready 12 years now I use z10 and when I need a new one I stay with blackberry so I hope it's will stay like all the good quality like the old bold and z10 handheld Reply Art Todd December 18, 2016 at 10:31 am I have owned a Blackberry for many years. I bought the Z10 and I liked it quite a bit. I just bought the DTEK 50 to stay with Blackberry but use a different OS in hopes that it would be an improvement. I will hold on to the Z10, and use the DTEK 50 with hopes that I may workout (not holding my breath). I am disappointed that Blackberry had to give up on the hardware because buyers flocked to iOS and Android. Oh well, nothing lasts forever. Reply Shahriar Balouchi December 18, 2016 at 6:08 am I own the DTek 60 and it's best phone I have ever owned. Software is great. The BlackBerry Hub is the best thing since sliced bread. Camera is better than any other in the market. I've owned it all from Samsung to Elephant to iPhone etc etc. The people writing and reading this article rather pay $1000 for an iPhone brand that hasn't invented a damn thing since retina and that's not even theirs. and what does Samsung have? What's new and innovative about samsung? Oh ya it blows up. Great. I will put the Dtek 60 up against any device. It will win hands down. These articles are garbage and biased. Pick up the phone and use it for yourself. Reply Kelsey Tidwell December 18, 2016 at 9:57 pm The article isn't biased. If a phone company stops making phones, then it's dead. Reply Brian December 18, 2016 at 5:47 am I've owned several BlackBerrys, currently both a Priv(the android phone) and a Classic(qnx). The priv is a good phone, the camera is really nice, it has a mediocre slide out keyboard, but I think it's too big and android is a mess. The classic I prefer a lot more. It has the best keyboard and the track pad, I can get things done twice as fast on it compared to the android one, everything in the OS works together and doesn't seem like a patchwork. I also use a nexus at work daily and had the early model nexus for personal use. I'm not happy that they ditched their own OS or sold the name. I don't plan to buy another phone at all- not just from TCL, but from anyone, I'll hold onto the Classic as long as I can until I see an OS that doesn't suck. I get stuck putting songs on my kids iPhone with the crap iTunes software also. I won't hold my breath, I ditched Windows for personal use and have OpenBSD on my desktop for similar reasons - I'm not putting up with questionable software and I'm not storing my files on someone else computer either like Google and Microsoft would like. I'm pretty much done, you'll have to contact me on my radio soon.(I'll gladly recommend the Kenwood TH-F6) Reply Joey Gladstone December 18, 2016 at 5:19 am This is one of the dumbest articles I have ever read. It mentions nothing of BlackBerrys new UEM software which handles and secures any device out there. BlackBerry doesn't care about making phones anymore. It's all about securing them and managing them now and guess what...THEY ARE THE INDUSTRY LEADER. So I think the BlackBerry name still means a lot to Enterprise and security concerned companies and users. Reply Ben Dova December 18, 2016 at 7:09 am Hear, hear! This article is totally out to lunch. Three minutes of my life that I won't get back. 3 actually, including the comment. Reply Kelsey Tidwell December 18, 2016 at 9:53 pm Blackberry doesn't care about making phones anymore. That's a great synopsis of this article. The article wasn't about software at all...it was about Blackberry phones. Soooo...the Blackberry name is dead as pertaining to the subject of this article. And the phone and security divisions would necessarily need to be totally separate...who wouldn't run from Blackberry security solutions manufactured in China? Reply Joseph December 18, 2016 at 4:08 am I owned almost every single Blackberry Bold: from 9000, 9700, 9780, 9900, then Z10, Q10, Z30, then Passport, Classic, and finally Flip. Recently, I almost purchase Dtek60 if I didn't read an article about where it was manufactured. That's it for Blackberry. Farewell. JB Reply Joey Gladstone December 18, 2016 at 5:21 am So your not going to buy a device that's made overseas then? Good luck finding one that isn't... Reply likefunbutnot December 18, 2016 at 3:22 am I've deployed the slightly expensive but vanilla BlackBerry Android handsets. They're decent hardware for the privacy conscious, but I couldn't help but think a less expensive Motorola handset would've been a better deal since my users didn't wind up using any of that BlackBerry specific software. On the other hand, I am glad that BES isn't important any more. I supported a bunch of dumb Exchange implementations because somebody HAD to have a Blackberry. It was a pain in my butt and I'm all too glad that everything just syncs directly to Google Apps now. One less stupid thing for ne to deal with. Reply John Dalton December 18, 2016 at 2:49 am I've owned BlackBerry phones for 14 years and I must say I love them. The current PRIV is an excellent. I will be sorry to see them go.

It's quite probable that the person you're speaking with has accidentally muted their microphone (by inadvertently tapping on the microphone icon). To rectify this issue, ask them to check and tap their microphone icon. If it has been muted, the icon will be white (rather than grey). Also, if the person you're speaking with is complaining that they can't hear you, you should check that you haven't muted your own microphone. Check your volume . Similar to checking that your microphone hasn't been accidentally muted, you should check that your volume (or your interlocutor's volume) isn't turned all or most of the way down. To rectify this problem, simply tap the Volume Up button several times, until you and/or your caller report that you can hear each other fine. Check your Wi-Fi or mobile data connection . Given that FaceTime relies on an internet connection to transmit video and audio, it stands to reason that it could struggle to fulfill either function in the event that your internet connection is weak. Is the microphone \"busy\"? One potential cause of FaceTime audio problems is that your microphone is actually being used by another app while you're trying to make a call. For example, certain messaging apps and music apps require the use of your device's microphone, so if you have them open while using FaceTime you or your caller might not be able to hear anything. If this is the case, close any app that is or might be using your device's microphone, and then try calling again. Check that your microphone is working properly . If you can't hear your caller or they can't hear you, both of you should check that your devices' microphones are working properly. You can do this on an iPhone (or iPad) by opening Voice Memos and recording yourself speaking into the primary (i.e. bottom) mic. Also with iPhones, you can check the rear and front mics (both at the top of the devices) by opening the Camera app and shooting a video (in which you talk) using the rear and then the front camera. If you can hear and record your voice normally using such tests, then clearly your microphone is working fine. If not, you might need to take your device into an Apple Store for repair. Try restarting your device . By closing all of the apps you have running, a normal restart could do the trick of enabling you to open FaceTime again and make a call with working audio. Obviously, it's also worth getting your caller to try this as well, just in case. Update your device to the latest OS . Often, new operating systems are introduced to clear bugs or flaws affecting previous versions, which might have possibly been preventing apps like FaceTime from working properly. It's for this reason that it's worth updating to the latest available OS for your device, if available. Refer to previous Lifewire articles to see how to do this on an iPhone , iPad or Mac . Restore your device to its factory settings . This is a pretty heavy-handed option, but if you've tried all of the methods above and FaceTime still doesn't produce audio normally, it's worth trying. Of course, before resetting your device to its default settings it would be a good idea to back it up, as explained in previous Lifewire articles for the iPhone, iPad , and Mac. Book an appointment at an Apple Store , or an authorized repair shop . Again, this is something you should do if none of the above steps have worked since the only remaining explanation is that your device is suffering from some kind of hardware issue that's preventing its microphone from functioning normally.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/fix-no-audio-on-facetime-4582043", "index": 0}

Reply Subaiyal August 23, 2019 at 6:29 pm Foolish person says recording everything will result in enormous amount of useless data. Well, Google can easily convert voice to text and an hour long speech will not take more than 200kb of data just in plain text. Google does record your voice in text form but as far as I think they use the data for advertisment purposes. Reply James Cook July 9, 2019 at 5:07 pm You think that changing the permissions is going to help? Google arent constrained by their own permissions api. Its nuts to think they are. They wrote the api that develpoers use but they have access at all levels because they wrote a lot of the code for android. Infact, a lot is not available to the public to access. Funnily enough, those bits are always where id put my hooks as a programmer to get what i need. They have root access to devices, and the filesystem. Ive looked deeply into a lot of google code and processes and so many dont make sense unless they are for what they apparently dont do. As a programmer reading their terms i see what is important to them and how they structure their data. They are fooling the uk government which isnt hard with a system of data collection that makes no sense as to the purpose they provide. The uk information commissioner doesnt understand his own job well enough to be able to understand what i put to them. Reply James Cook July 9, 2019 at 4:46 pm Christ, read their terms. Their tireless omissions speak volumes about how they collect data and why the facade of privacy doesnt bother them but covers them from further inspection. They have strange processes that make no sense except to gather information. They dont want information thats less specific than other forms. They survive off data as their business. They dont give you the option not to share. Theres not the space here, but they collect data on you many times over in overlapping ways. Theres no escape. You could buy a non smartphone and quit any internet use and still be in trouble. Make sure it has no bluetooth, internet, wifi, and btw, dont call any people with smartphones, oh, and you think then youre fine? Theres more.....oh, and dont use chrome or google search on your smartphone and you think youll be fine? The first 2 alternatives i tried were problematic. Yahoo and firefox, both caused connections to google.

I decided to do the most radical thing and deny Google App permissions to the Microphone. (I hope that really even works.) Dear Google, this recording everything all the time breaks your oath of \"do no evil.\" Please stop doing it. Reply Jim cook July 9, 2019 at 4:41 pm They scrapped that oath recently btw. Probably because its existence caused ppl to ask why they created it in the first place and it seems more sinister to have it Reply zylstra April 6, 2019 at 12:56 am \"but it is not recording everything you say and uploading it to Google\" - Google doesn't need to do this. Google only needs to have a list of (ten of thousands of) keywords stored locally then upload only those that it thinks are relevant. Reply name September 16, 2018 at 6:00 pm \"does not record until it hears hot word/phrase\"... which means it is constantly listening and sending words off to google cloud computing to be analyzed to see if it IS the keyphrase ... Reply James Bruce September 17, 2018 at 11:46 am No, that's why a specific wake word needs to be used: for local analysis on the device. Reply Sandy July 28, 2018 at 4:43 pm I have Voice & Audio Activity paused and I still get a message saying \"saving audio to gmail account\" everytime I press the microphone. So it doesn't appear that I can stop Google from saving my speech when I use the microphone. The only way I can keep Google from saving audio is not to use the microphone at all. Very dissappointing. Reply Heidi July 23, 2018 at 9:22 am Thank you so much for this! This morning I wanted to take a screenshot for the very first time and wondered out loud how to do it. Then I only typed 'how to make a' into Google search and it came up with '.... screenshot on a samsung' as first choice. Then I get an email saying my service has been 'upgraded' to Google Assistant'. Coincidence? I think not. The Google support pages were useless in finding out how to restrict this insidious software; it may have taken me an hour to work through it all but your simple instructions have helped me so much - I am not a Luddite but decry the underhand tracking and algorithms following my mobile use (and really I just want a phone!) Remember, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you!

Never been a fan of data grabbing/ tracking/ geolocating/ learning my face/ fingerprint, or voice for my 'Conveinience'. To me, it's invasive and creepy. Reply Xane Myers March 4, 2018 at 11:49 pm There's something else that can be done during the last step: Go into Google Assistant's settings, \"phone\", then there's an option named \"preferred input\", which can be set to keyboard. This does the same thing as tapping the keyboard icon when Assistant appears, but you don't have to quickly tap that button every time.

In the top bar, you will see that iOS has three available protocols: L2TP, PPTP, and IPSec. If your VPN is provided by an employer, then they will most likely inform you as to which protocol to use. If you are using your own hosted VPN, however, then be sure to use a form which is supported by your provider. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 39 4 Enter a description. This could be anything you want. For instance, if this is a work VPN, then you could describe it as \"Work.\" If you plan to use this VPN for watching an out-of-country Netflix, then you could call it \"Canadian Netflix.\" Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 40 5 Enter your server information. This information should have been given to you either by your VPN provider or your employer. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 41 6 Enter your \"Account\" name.

After choosing \"RSA SecurID,\" click \"Save.\" IPSec will also allow you to use CRYPTOCard, or any certificates in the raw formats .cer, .crt, .der, .p12, and .pfx .

Consult with your employer or VPN provider if you do not have this information. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 44 9 Enter your shared \"Secret\" if you require it. A \"secret\" is used to further authenticate your account. Much like the \"key\" of an RSA Secure ID, the \"secret\" is typically a series of letters and numbers given to you by a provider or employer. If it has not been provided to you then you either may not need to enter anything in that field or you may need to contact your provider or employer in order to obtain the secret. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 45 10 Enter the \"Group Name\" for an IPSec connection if needed.

Click the button next to this field and ensure it is highlighted in green if you want all your internet traffic to go through the VPN. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 47 12 Click \"Save\" in the top right corner to save your settings. At this point, your VPN is connected. You may turn your VPN connection on or off from the main \"Settings\" page by clicking its corresponding button. If the button is green, then you are connected. If the button is gray, then you are not connected.

Reply Kannon Y June 11, 2018 at 2:39 pm Hi, it's possible to create a backup of your phone by using the Android SDK, but it's a huge PITA. (Google for Android SDK Full Backup.) The easiest way is to install the custom recovery and perform the backup through the recovery. Unfortunately, that carries with it the risk of bricking your phone, which is why we make backups in the first place. Reply Thomas June 12, 2018 at 3:21 am Thanks, Kannon... I'll look at SDK, I'm in no huury (yet), so sometimes PITA is educational enough ?

Reply Kannon Yamada May 7, 2018 at 12:02 am I can't say for certain what the issue is. Would you happen to be on some sort of limited data plan in a country outside of the US? I do know this though: Chrome can be configured to use a proxy. It's called mobile data compression. If a proxy is enabled and Chrome is the only app still working, that means there is some other issue with the way your device connects to the internet. Malware is known to redirect internet traffic, except in cases where encrypted proxies are used. But I could be totally wrong. Have you tried a factory reset? My advice is this: try booting up in Safe Mode and see what happens.

Have you tried safe mode yet? If you are getting error messages and an automatic reboot BEFORE you can even operate the device, it may be due to malware. Normally, I would recommend a factory reset, but in this case, you may first want to try booting into recovery mode and then pulling the files -- although that may not be possible.

Reply Goku March 29, 2017 at 4:27 am My apps either quit or restart when ever i connect or disconnect the physical keyboard (i have an RCA pro 10) Reply Kannon Y April 1, 2017 at 10:00 pm That sounds like a hardware issue. Although it doesn't sound like a hardware issue at all. The RCA Pro 10 (Viking or something else?) is designed to work with a keyboard. There may be an application that's causing this. The only way I know of to troubleshoot this issue would be to perform a factory reset and then attach the keyboard. If it continues killing apps, then I would guess that the device is somehow defective. Reply goku April 2, 2017 at 12:58 am actually I've found the issue is a mix of hardware and software the actual hardware issue is known that is unsteady contact between the tablet and the pins from the case or other wise unsteady connection between the keyboard and tablet ... that's the hardware side the software side is if an app doesn't have a programed response to a change in keyboard state androids default behavior is to kill and restart the app so from the app programmer side the issue would be solved adding one or two lines of code give or take but I don't know if there's an end user solution aside perhaps from buying a new keyboard case Reply Kannon Yamada April 2, 2017 at 1:16 am That's an excellent hardware analysis, thank you for sharing. It sounds then as if the hardware is defective? RCA tablets from Walmart, like the Galileo, IIRC carry a two year warranty. I took a closer look at the pins on the RCA tablets -- they are really flimsy compared to the pogo pins on more expensive devices. It wouldn't surprise me at all if this were the problem. I think there's an option in Android for controlling keyboard behavior. You can configure it to behave differently when a keyboard is connected. You see this option sometimes on devices with physical keyboards. The first time I saw it show up was in Android 5 or 6 IIRC. You might have some luck changing these settings.

This can be caused by a lack of network connectivity. Please make sure you have a good network connection.\" When I check the network connection appears to be fine and working for all apps prior to the update. Have you run into this issue and do you know a solution? Reply Kannon February 24, 2017 at 3:31 pm Hi Sheila, I have run into this issue and normally it means your internet connection is the culprit. Are you connected to a Wi-Fi network or over a mobile connection? Sometimes your phone may behave differently following a system update. I normally advise attempting a factory reset as it will save you a lot of time troubleshooting all the various causes of this problem. However, there's a good chance that the problem can continue following a factory reset. Try the following before using the nuclear option (factory reset): * Restart your device. * Try disconnecting (forgetting the network) from and reconnecting to your Wi-Fi network -- make sure you have the right network password. * You can also try removing your Google account and then re-adding it. But unless you're familiar with this process, you may want to do a factory reset. * There's also the option of clearing the caches on the Google Play Store, Google Play Services, and Google Framework -- but unless you're familiar with the process, you are better off with a factory reset. Reply Lori February 16, 2017 at 4:37 am For the last month, I've been having a problem with my CM cleaner and other cleaner. I have full Norton coverage, plus the anti-virus software that came with my phone, so I should be covered all around, SAFE PHONE..any way my point is every time I try to clean my phone junk it will remove so much and then the screen goes black, then to my home screen, it does this on all cleaners, sometimes on Google or while playing a game. I installed a different Anti-virus and cleaner, it says no threats found,But it has this on the same screen. Virus DB:d3fXLgJTa90nqYVy..what does this mean? If you can tell me I would greatly appreciate it. Thank You for your time Reply Kannon February 24, 2017 at 3:25 pm Hi Lori, I wouldn't use any of those anti-virus applications. Google Play Store apps are, overwhelmingly, safer than downloading and installing apps that you find online. In fact, some of those anti-virus programs actually are viruses in disguise. Try uninstalling them. If you continue to experience problems, factory reset your device. That particular code is a data-base entry for a virus. It could be a false positive, a phony anti-virus program, or a real entry. But if you download apps exclusively from the Play Store, then it's probably a phone anti-virus program.

Any help would be appreciated thanks. Reply Kannon February 15, 2017 at 6:33 pm Hi Patrick, I'm not familiar with that particular device, but I'm assuming it's a white label version of the Android-based set-top-box that's circulating on Amazon. Does it have an Amlogic S905 processor? I ask because many games will not run properly (no matter what you do) on some of the lesser-supported processors. Basically, unless you have a Qualcomm processor, whether or not games run correctly is a game of dice. Much of the reason why is because games are so resource intensive. Many of them are not coded in Java, for this reason. But if they're not written in Java, that means each game's processor much be supported by the app. I suspect that the only way to get the games to run correctly is to request support from the developer. Considering the sheer number of Android boxes based on Amlogic processors out there, the devs might be receptive to any requests. Amlogic processors are, as I understand it, completely open source. In theory, that should make it easier for developers to get their games running on the platform. Reply Kevin February 3, 2017 at 7:20 am Hi, I have a problem with the touchscreen controls malfunctioning frequently when I play games on my tablet. Nothing I try seems to help usually or doesn't help for long. I clear the catche, data, delete junk, boost ram, restart, and curse. It works best when I first turn on the tablet and seems to get worse the longer I play. Makes me think it's a heat issue. Any ideas? Reply Kannon Yamada February 6, 2017 at 11:41 am Touchscreen problems were very common on devices such as the OnePlus One, Nexus 7, and other devices. These were hardware issues that weren't correctable using software or firmware tweaks. Can I ask what device you have? It could also be a sign of a defective device. Reply Kevin February 6, 2017 at 1:44 pm I have an Irulu X10 tablet, very inexpensive but I really like it mostly. It does a lot better on some games than others. Reply Kannon February 6, 2017 at 1:57 pm It sounds like the digitizer isn't properly isolated, which leads to sensitivity issues. This is similar to the issues that the Nexus 7 2013 had, where the touchscreen issues would only show up in some games that required lots of tapping on the screen. You can always try a factory reset or other options, but those should not correct the problem. I'm sorry about that. However, I totally agree that China-branded/designed tablets offer a great alternative to those from large US/Taiwan corporations. You get a lot of bang for your buck if you know the brands. Haz January 24, 2017 at 6:54 am Hi my friend is using Asus then after he has formatted his phone he still have virus can you help? Reply Kannon January 26, 2017 at 10:06 am What have you tried so far? The surest method of resolving malware is the factory reset. However, you can also navigate to the app menu in Settings and remove the apps that you don't use. Most malware hides itself from the app drawer. But I can't think of any malware that can hide within the Settings menu.

My phone is 1 yr old Reply Kannon Y January 21, 2017 at 9:44 am I'm not familiar with this issue. Does your phone disconnect from the cellular tower or the WiFi? What model of phone is it? In general, issues like this can be either hardware, firmware, or software. If it's software, a factory reset SHOULD be able to fix the issue. If the factory reset doesn't work then it's either firmware or hardware. If the hardware is faulty, there's nothing you can do and must return the device under warranty. If the firmware is the cause, the carrier might be able to fix the issue, but your best bet is almost always to RMA (return) the device.

Have you tried wiggling it?

But replacing display ic is a risky job sometimes phone may dead perminently. please help me Reply Kannon Y December 14, 2016 at 7:06 pm That's exactly what it sounds like. If there's any damage to the display components on the motherboard, it means no matter what screen you use, the device will remain broken. In theory, you can attempt to troubleshoot this yourself by trying to connect to an external display (unlikely, as you would need to somehow navigate multiple menus in order to switch to an external display). But the most direct solution is to replace the device entirely. Most display components are non-replaceable. That means once they break, there are no DIY means to repair the device. I'm very sorry.

I just got a new Android phone (Wiko Ufeel model). When I clicked on the File manager (wanted to set all photos taken to be saved in SD card instead of internal storage), they asked whether or not to grant permission for File Manager to make calls. It didn't make sense to me so I clicked Deny and prematurely checked the \"Never Show this again\". Now, whenever I click on File Manager, it crashes. Any ideas on how to fix this? Reply Kannon Yamada October 10, 2016 at 5:46 pm Last I checked, it shouldn't need those permissions. I would install a different file manager.

Reply Kannon Y September 22, 2016 at 7:43 pm Let me see if I'm understanding the question properly. You have several issues: * Google Play is opening without you manually starting the app. * WiFi and data are turning on, even though you've switched them off. * Apps are reinstalling themselves even though you've uninstalled them. The only situation in which this happens is when you're rooted and you have malicious software installed. However, it might be that I'm misunderstanding. Can you confirm?

Reply Kannon Y September 21, 2016 at 12:57 am Can I ask what kind of video player you're using? Is it in a browser or are you watching video files? If it's a video file, what kind of video file is it, such as MP4? If you know how it's encoded, that's pretty important.

Reply Kannon Y September 21, 2016 at 1:00 am I prefer using either Chrome or Firefox for playing web videos. Try using one of them and let me know what happens. Although, given that this is a Micromax we're talking about, chances are the phone's limited specs are the problem. Reply Rahul August 30, 2016 at 3:46 pm I did a factory reset to my gionee ctrl v4s.

Reply bgaskin August 21, 2016 at 3:20 am My phone reboots itself updating or UNinstalling any app. The reboot occurs 0-2s after the app change. Installing an app for the first time is no problem. I have a rooted Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge running Lollipop. I've tried a few cache-clearing / permissions fix ideas. I'm trying to avoid reinstalling the OS if at all possible. My question is what can I do to best identify what's going on, rather than just trying something and seeing? How are the logs on android? Something like Event Viewer for Windows? Or dmesg for linux? What built in logs are there, or what can I install for better logging? I haven't seen anyone post this exact problem anywhere, but if someone's seen it, I'd glad to hear about real-life experience. Reply Kannon Yamada August 22, 2016 at 5:13 pm The problem with root is that it tampers with system files, which can have unpredictable effects on your device. It also dramatically increases the chance that you will at some point in the future need to perform a factory reset. You may, or may not, want to undo root and see if that fixes the problem. However, undoing root oftentimes causes an unbootable device. So you are definitely right that using a log analysis is the correct course of action. For logs, I use CatLog. It's not any different than the other log-catching apps out there. Basically, run the app, cause the crash, and then check the log. It may or may not catch the crash, depending on how sudden it is. Another option is to use the Android Debug Bridge and the development kit. I use this method more often than CatLog (because I've rid myself of root). It's pretty easy to do too, it just requires a fairly large download (Android Studio). Here are the instructions: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat.html Reply Vicki August 16, 2016 at 6:19 pm My Android tablet is all of a sudden in a mirror like image and I can't figure out how to reset it Reply Kannon Yamada August 22, 2016 at 5:01 pm I believe that means you've enabled developer options and enabled the RTL (right to left) handling mode. It's designed for single, left-handed operation. You should be able to resolve this by going to Settings --> Developer Options --> and de-checking the RTL mode.

Could u find solution for this Reply Kannon Yamada August 22, 2016 at 5:58 pm I can't even imagine what's going on. If the wallpaper displays, but the apps don't, that could be any number of failures. Have you tried entering the recovery mode or the bootloader? Safe Mode is something I would normally have suggested, since the phone appears to be mostly booting up on its own. The Android boot process, depending on the version of the OS, tends to follow a basic formula: https://community.nxp.com/docs/DOC-102546 It sounds like it's not properly compiling applications though. I would normally advise a factory reset, but this could be a fairly serious problem. Reply Anonymous August 12, 2016 at 2:05 pm For the last few days, every time I take my phone off charge, it makes an audible announcement saying how much battery life I have left.

I have a Moto G running Android 5.1 Reply Kannon Yamada August 13, 2016 at 6:03 pm Hi Alex, it might be an accessibility setting (which is in the settings menu).

Reply simon August 10, 2016 at 3:41 pm everytime I load media on my phone (gallery/whatsapp etc) it grinds to a halt Am using OnePlus 2 Reply Kannon Yamada August 11, 2016 at 7:39 pm That can be almost anything, but a good rule of thumb with smartphones is to never overload the eMMC module. Once you've filled up 75% of the drive's capacity, it will begin slowing down. The best fix is to clear out around a quarter of the capacity and let it sit for 24 hours in airplane mode. Or consider a factory reset.

Reply Rojie August 9, 2016 at 8:46 am Hello, newly installed Pokemon Go crashes everytime I input my birthday 3/8/1992. please help. Reply Kannon Yamada August 9, 2016 at 12:49 pm It might be that your phone doesn't have enough RAM to run the program. Pokemon Go requires 2GB of RAM to run properly. I have heard about people getting it to run on 1GB, but I'm not sure if that's entirely true. Your phone has 512MB of RAM, which means you have 1/4 the amount required. Unfortunately, unless I've misread about your phone's specs, it appears you won't be able to play it until you upgrade. Reply Visbyper July 24, 2016 at 8:22 am I have a Samsung S6. randomly it flips beetween the view of all open program and the app I use Have made a factory reset, but the problem i still there. Reply Kannon Yamada July 24, 2016 at 4:04 pm I've never heard of this issue before. The \"view of all open program\" is sometimes referred to as the multi-tasking screen. It shouldn't open unless the user has opened it. If it's opening by default, there's a possibility that it's being caused by a rogue app. Have you tried booting the device in safe mode?

Reply Kannon Yamada July 11, 2016 at 10:52 pm A lot of potential problems can cause this issue. A damaged eMMC module can prevent you from installing apps. So can permission issues.

I have also tried taking a screen shot of the problem I'm talking about, but the screenshot just shows the normal display. Any idea what else I can do before sending it in? Reply Kannon Yamada May 28, 2016 at 1:42 am I'm not sure what is causing that issue, but it sounds like a hardware problem. It might be that the GPU is faulty since it's not drawing the screen correctly. But basically if a factory reset doesn't fix the issue, the problem is most likely hardware related. And smartphones aren't totally user-serviceable. So it might have to be sent back. There are a few option that technicians use to attempt repair of problems like this, but I'm doubtful it would work. I've heard of fresh factory images being pushed via USB to the phone. If the company that makes your phone offers factory images, you could try that -- but the safer options is to just return it.

A PC, though, is surrounded by metal and pretty much impervious to the radiation emitted by smartphones. The FCC should inspect all devices capable of emitting wireless frequencies for possible problems such as this. This is definitely not my field of expertise though. Electronics are really, really complicated and almost anything is possible. There are also law enforcement agencies that use devices known as \"Stingrays\" which are portable cellular towers, which probably aren't vetted by the FCC and may cause the problems you've encountered. But if you are really concerned, try picking up a cheap prepaid phone and see if it causes the same problems. jared February 26, 2016 at 3:05 am has any one had the problem of the phone rebooting if its not in use or on charge ? mine does when it goes into screen lock for about 5 minutes it will keep rebooting . is there a fix for this i can do at home ?

Reply Kannon Yamada November 23, 2015 at 3:36 pm There shouldn't be any SDKs located in the download directory. Did you root the phone at any point? Have you tried a factory reset? Reply Anonymous November 10, 2015 at 7:43 am HELLO, here is the problem am facing, there is a app called \"Penguin time\" keep opening in my device every time i use internet and if i use any of my app too many popups appears on my screen like HOLA LAUNCHER,OLX and many more. please help me Reply Kannon Yamada November 10, 2015 at 8:08 pm Vikrant, this is a simple issue to repair. I advocate a factory reset, as some malware on older Android handsets can alter your system directory. If you'd prefer not to factory reset, use the Safe Mode method. Search the internet for your particular handset, and include \"Safe Mode\". You should find instructions on how to enter Safe Mode. When in Safe Mode you can remove the offending apps. Just go to Settings --> Apps --> Downloaded and start killing apps you recently downloaded.

In that moment my phone was not working. Please let me know any possible ways to fix the phone. Reply Kannon Yamada August 26, 2015 at 7:01 pm So, if I understand correctly, it's a system update that causes the issue? What version of Android is it on and what version of Android is it upgrading to? Did you root your device in any way? Did you use a custom ROM? Do you have a custom recovery installed? You might be able to resolve the issue with a factory reset, but if you've modified your OS in any way, that might not be the first option you should consider. The Acore process is related to a number of system functions. I've experienced it before and have resolved it by wiping data for my contacts. Just go to apps --> all --> contacts and then wipe data.

The problem is when the device reboots it shows the normal android installation animations and an 'Erasing' notation underneath over and over again and in between the screen blinks. I have tried to go into the recovery mode by pressing the power button and volume up button. But it goes the same. I also tried to turn on the device after removing the battery and putting in again but didn't help either. As I tried to put the charger on of my device it doesn't show the conventional battery charging animation rather the same animation. Please let me know any possible ways to fix the phone. Reply Kannon Yamada August 9, 2015 at 2:32 pm Have you tried wiping the cache partition or DALVIK cache from the recovery or bootloader? Every Android phone is different. Some can have a recovery preboot environment or they can have a bootloader. Sometimes the bootloader is the same as a recovery. It's all dependent on your manufacturer's whims. I don't think any method will work, unfortunately. Did you try anything like rooting or installing a custom ROM before the device stopped working? Reply Anonymous August 1, 2015 at 9:32 pm Hello Sir ! I recently had a factory data reset for my android phone ( a samsung gt-s5300 model ) and since that day , my phone's keeps vibrating without obvious reason . The frequency is about 5-6 times a minute . You can imagine how disturbing it is , not to mention the battery drain ! I've tried several things like volume up+power off to wipe cache , though nothing seems to work ! I'm running an old android version ( 2.3.6 ) . I would appreciate any help . Thanks ! Reply Kannon Yamada August 1, 2015 at 11:14 pm Have you tried turning vibrate off? Reply Anonymous August 2, 2015 at 3:17 pm The vibration is off. Reply Kannon Yamada August 2, 2015 at 6:37 pm If this occurs following a factory reset, then it is a hardware issue. Any problems that persists through a factory reset is a hardware problem (or firmware). You can try adjusting settings, but the phone is so old that you are better off upgrading.

Reply Anonymous July 14, 2015 at 7:19 pm always showing UNABLE TO ROOT.. thats it. Reply Kannon Yamada July 14, 2015 at 7:20 pm Samsung devices can be really tricky to root. The root process is determined by the hardware -- specifically the kind of system-on-a-chip (SoC). If you're using an international edition of the Galaxy Note 2, then you may have an Exynos chip, instead of a Qualcomm. In this case, you'd need to find a root method that's specific to Exynos on the Note 2. And then there's all kinds of additional caveats and barriers -- on top of that. Reply Anonymous June 29, 2015 at 9:04 am I have Galaxy A-5 , When we resart the phone It shows old version of play store result error - \"unfortunately google stopped -google.ap\" like that ,when we install new version thru Xender..It starts working. ..pls advise permanent solution , when our battery washed off..we need to again install latest version of play store..moreover many times its screen goes black..here only we need to reboot the mobile Reply Kannon Yamada June 29, 2015 at 11:19 pm Did you try any of the tips outlined in this article? Reply sd May 24, 2015 at 5:49 pm My phone is samsung galaxy A5. Back arrow button on the bottom right corner of the phone gets pressed automatically. This makes the screen goes back until it reaches home screen. This happens when I browse , play games and videos as well as when texting . I did factory reset thrice and also manufacturer again reset the software twice . manfacturer also advised to change SIM and scratchguard. But the phone does the malfunction even without SIM. The problem doesn't occur always but frequently it happens. Please advise Reply Kannon Y May 24, 2015 at 9:36 pm Sorry for your troubles. When a factory reset doesn't resolve the issue, this is almost always caused by a hardware failure. It can be something as simple as liquid or something conductive inadvertently activating that part of the screen or it can be a failing digitizer. There's a handful of other things that you can try, but none of them will likely work. RMA/return is probably the most time efficient use of your time. Please contact customer service and let them know that you've already tried a factory reset. That should pretty much clear up the options they have available and they'll probably give you an RMA number. Good luck. Reply habe May 22, 2015 at 5:57 pm I tap to reset and than show me erasing,after that i wait 2 hours and still wont load Reply Kannon Y May 22, 2015 at 6:02 pm If factory reset doesn't resolve the problem then the device will probably need to be returned to the manufacturer for repair. However, if you've installed a custom ROM, you need to perform a factory reset according to the instructions provided by the ROM creator.

Reply Kannon Y March 17, 2015 at 7:30 pm The bootloader is a preboot environment where you can factory reset your phone without having to actually load the phone's operating system. From the bootloader you can sometimes access a recovery mode or recovery the operating system. http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/what-is-bootloader-and-how-to-unlock-bootloader-on-android-phones-complete-guide/ You would need to Google your specific phone and \"how to enter bootloader\" in order to get details. Most devices include some method of recovering the device from the bootloader (or recovery mode, which is accessible from the bootloader).

And again some sort of annoying pop-up message came out. 'Unfortunately' something blah blah has stop. Can someone help me fix it. My phone is HUAWEI ASCEND Y300. Thank you. Please response. Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 8:36 pm Factory resets sometimes fail. Normally, you want your device plugged in while it's resetting. You can also perform a factory reset from the bootloader -- this is more reliable, but might cause you issues. Can you list what service has stopped? There's a lot of causes for these kinds of things -- but oftentimes you can resolve the issue by wiping the cache of the app/service that has failed. It's the same process as the Google Play crashing fix, up at the top. Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 8:36 pm What I meant by \"it's the same process\": You would need to wipe the cache/data of the service that is crashing (not Google Play).

Here's some of the other fixes: Reply Silverlokk March 16, 2015 at 8:36 am I was getting Low on Storage warnings. Found that Google Books was storing downloaded books in my internal SD storage, and I can't find a way to move them to the SD card. Had about 500MB of books, had to remove some of them, which meant I'd have to be online to read them, but that's not a major hassle. Still, I wish that Books would let me select the SD card as storage for downloaded books As an aside, a few of those books are from MUo.com :) Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 7:49 pm Google Services are notorious for doing things like this. They basically hate it when we use local storage rather than cloud storage. I hope it's not saving the files to the system directory. That would be simply vindictive. Reply B.Sasidharan March 17, 2015 at 4:13 pm From the very begining when an incomming call receives whetger that call no: is already saved in my phone or not the caller no: wll automatically display in my Nexus 5 phone.But only after I downloaded the lollipop os the display of incomming call in the monotor can't be seen.I can here only the ring tone.If I want to contact the caller I have to press the battery key, then touch the phone key where three options showes where I touch the middle one, then only I can hear the caller sound& identity.This will take a lot of waste of time.

My phone is Google Nexus 5 Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 7:48 pm Is it totally blank or does just the number show? If it's just the number, I think this is actually an issue with Google Contacts, I believe. If the number differs even slightly from the one you've got in your contacts, it won't display the name.

Reply Chinmay S March 14, 2015 at 11:24 am Google Play doesn't allow me to download apps even if my phone has more than enough space. Even if I have 400 MB of free space, it won't allow me to download a 20 MB file. I have to run Clean Master to remove junk files which has no impact on free space whatsoever and then I am able to download it. And these are just Android problems, there are many more problems with Android phones. For example, not getting a single update on $700-$800 flagship phone in the last 2 years. The solution to these problems is buy an iPhone. Problem SOLVED. Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 7:44 pm I would use CCleaner rather than Clean Master. They were once the best cleaning app around, but then started doing things that were not acceptable with customer data. It sounds as if you have an international (Exynos) Samsung Galaxy S4. Samsung was notorious for pumping out different versions of the same device. They are the absolute worst company to buy from. There's more reliable companies out there right now -- the Nexus series probably being among the best. iPhone does solve many of the problems. Even so, I'd much rather have a $350 Nexus 5 over a $640 iPhone 6. The problem with Android phones is that apps can save data to locations with limited space. A lot of music apps cache data in directories with limited space. And then they never run cleanup operations on those locations. I recommend using DiskUsage to locate the places where data is piling up and then uninstalling the app responsible. Reply Tom March 17, 2015 at 2:49 am Sounds like you got ripped off with your $800 phone. Don't blame the system for your poor purchases. Not getting updates isn't an \"Android problem\"... it's a greedy cell phone carrier problem. Just look at how long is taken the carriers to roll out Lollipop.

Reply Funhouse123 January 6, 2017 at 6:41 am For anyone curious, you use your whatsapp on your mobile to scan the QR code for whatsapp web. Once you are far away from the computer or leave, the web app disconnects you from whatsapp and you would either have to have your phone within distance in a specific time frame, usually 1 minute, or if the phone is away for far too long you would have to reconnect by going back on the whatsapp on mobile and scanning the QR code again. In order to see if your whatsapp is connected in any other computer/laptop you just go to settings where the QR code is located and you can disconnect from any device. Either way, if you are spying on someone and they leave or disconnect you, you would have to start over again. Not that I spy, but I recommend immediately after connecting you download all conversations you can view in case you get disconnected and you need any sort of proof/information until you can get a hold of their phone again. There used to be apps where you could login into whatsapp with your phone number and password, but since whatsapp launched their web app many of them are gone. You can look around and see if any of them are still around. Reply Archa January 5, 2017 at 9:36 am how can identify previously logged whatsap session id from a deleted account?

Those Chrome extensions just simplify the access to official WhatsApp Web client. I have a button in my Chrome toolbar, I click it and after the traditional registration through QR-code I can use WhatsApp Web. Next time I should not repeat the registration. They do not replace WhatsApp itself. But I just try to understand which is better. Reply Evgeniy April 22, 2015 at 1:31 pm Dear Mihir Patkar, Thank you for the review. Despite there are many reviews for WhatsApp Web I find this one to be interesting. I am a novice WhatsApp user. This app is not popular in Ukraine. Viber kicks ass, as well as Hangouts does. I just started to study WhatsApp just to see the difference. So I found out there are a dozen of Chrome extensions to improve WhatsApp Web UX. I tried this one [Broken Link Removed] It's free. And almost all of them are free but WhatsApp Web Extension that costs about $1. I do not know why :) That extension does the same that free alternatives do. How do you find those extensions? Which is better on you opinion? Thank you! Reply Mihir Patkar April 22, 2015 at 4:39 pm Hey Evgeniy, thanks for the kind words. I wouldn't recommend using anything except the official WhatsApp Web client. WhatsApp has been banning accounts of people using alternative WhatsApp apps on Android, so it's best to play it safe with the Web version too. Plus, this way, you are guaranteed that your chats are encrypted and safe, which is a risk with third-party clients.

Reply Daniele January 31, 2015 at 8:42 am For example, if I have to write long messages, it's more confortable writing them with a real keyboard instead of the smartphone virtual keyboard. I also can copy & paste text or links directly from my PC (i.e., I read an interesting article, and I want to send an excerpt and the link to the entire article). And with Whatsapp Web I can send images and videos I have on my PC (in the hard disk, in a network share, in a USB key, ...) without need to transfer them on the smartphone. Think it as an extension of your smartphone: you could connect a real keyboard to the smartphone to write faster and an external storage (USB key or hard disk, network share, etc...) to retrieve images and videos and send them; or you simply could use Whatsapp Web from your PC (and with a >=17\" LCD monitor vs. <=5\" smartphone screen! ;-) ).

Any idea how I can overcome this? Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 9:24 am I don't think it works on tablets (unless you're using a Windows tablet).

WhatsApp on web do work on android tablets (need to check the \"request desktop site\" in browser though) but for some reason the layout itself forces parts of the code outside the screen view on my Nexus 7 as well (zooming out won't help) making it unable to scan properly...

Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 7:16 am It's only in the official WhatsApp app. In fact, WhatsApp is rejecting accounts of those using third-party apps like WhatsApp Plus, so you might want to consider shifting to the official client.

If you log out, your privacy is guaranteed. Same thing here. Reply pmshah January 27, 2015 at 3:49 am So even in cloning the features of Viber they did a half baked job ! I really wonder why Viber has not displaced Whats app altogether. Viber is available on ALL platforms as also supports audio conversation. In fact I have managed to make it work on the combo of desktop + conventional ( read non- smart) mobile phone. Best part is, unlike whatsapp, it is tied to the number and not to the instrument. BTW audio conversation is still missing. Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:14 am I honestly think there are plenty of great IM apps out there which can give WhatsApp a run for its money. No idea why this one is more successful. Reply Bud January 27, 2015 at 3:29 am CAN T USE on an Apple iMac and recently read where Apple no longer supported it!

Reply ibnsina May 7, 2015 at 9:07 am I have the same problem. Just point your camera as if you were not seeing the screen. Point it making sure your objective is in front of the code and at a distance so the QR code would fit into the square green box. The problem is that the image shown on the screen is shifted to the right and so the left black part is in fact the result of spanning the left margin. Reply Kumar Mullackal January 26, 2015 at 5:11 am The best part of it is, once you are home on your desktop or Laptop you can confine yourself to that alone for updating your social networking. And Google input tools work too ! Texting in regional languages in their primitive type writer layout on the desktop itself is an added advantage. Would be appreciated on having more controls from the web version itself like deleting posts and so. Hope this technical issue will be taken care of ! Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:06 am I think you can expect those features to roll out slowly through updates, Kumar. I don't see what is preventing them from letting you delete conversations or exit groups through the web interface right now. I actually hadn't thought of the use of regional language, that's a fantastic point!

Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:00 am Bikas is absolutely correct here.

Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 4:57 am That's strange. Please clarify what is happening and we'll try to sort it out together :) So you can see the QR code on screen and when you point your phone's camera to it (through the WhatsApp Web app), nothing happens? Reply Simar January 27, 2015 at 1:14 pm Hi, Yes! this happened with me too. Please try the following steps: Reload the page: web.whatsapp.com. This would bring a new set of encrypted bar code image and then you can again click on : whatsapp web {please make sure to log out from your device first before performing this step}. I realized that, i am keeping the phone scanner mapped to the web image quite close. When i moved the mobile little far away {still in the bar code focus}, it immediately picked up. One change that i have noticed is that: Web whatsapp doesn't allow you to change your profile picture OR commonly known as: DP- Display Picture...If i have to change, i would need to do this form my mobile. Same goes in for the display message: is doesn't show nay on the web side. Reply Simar January 27, 2015 at 1:23 pm Hi All, Few questions: If whatsapp web is a web interface of the mobile app {therefore we need to be connected on our mobile}, why are we not getting Setting tab as present on our mobile to be a mirror image on web too? As per the feature of \"Last seen online\"- this was something as applicable to mobile..is this same when connected in web side as well? If so! i am connected OR online on web so, would all my contacts see me online all the time even if i have a different setting of last seen online on my mobile? How is this feature synching?

Reply Got Your Number August 5, 2013 at 5:22 am If a simple 'note-taking' app (after all we're talking about scribblings here, not rocket engine design), such as Evernote, is a 'steep learning curve', then it's already failed as a simple note-taking app. I note that others use 2 or more apps for 'note-taking'. Again, utterly daft. We've become tourists in our own lives, living life staring at screens, shuffling information around on them. I utterly reject that life. If that's your thing, enjoy. But one thing I know. On your deathbed, you're not going to be reflecting on how you never found the perfect note-taking app during you brief life. Reply Theo Benschop March 7, 2017 at 7:01 pm @Got Your Number, It's in the history of mankind indeed a simple thing: in former times people had to hunt distraction-free for animals or to work very hard in the fields in order to have something to eat. In the here and now of the days of the digital internet however many people in western high wages countries have in the offices as a sort of slave of the banks indeed become tourists in their own lifes, living indeed a life that is structured by the far from distracrion-free moments that he or she is staring at screens, indeed shuffling information about the history of mankind that everybody already knows around them. So the only way in utterly rejecting that life will be plan B in a one way distraction-free ticket to paradise, where one can't see one single office where the people are far from disstraction-free staring at their screens, what they apperantly as a sort slave of the bank enjoy. So only God knows when one is on his or her deathbed whether he or she will remember the things that he or she made far from distraction-free a note of in order to be able to reflect on for instance how he or she never found the perfect note-taking app during his or hers brief lifes.

I have both my Youtube favorites and Pinterest repins going over there via IFTTT to have one collected hub of things I like. It also has my collection of interesting tech articles and app tips, some recipes, movies and games I want to check out etc. If only I'd have an easy way to sync it with Goodreads and Hypejar as well to make it even more of a centralized hub for my interests. And if I want to, I can just make a simple checklist as well without the extra fuzz. I used to use Out of Milk, but after I realized I could do the same stuff with another app I was already using, I switched over to Springpad (partly because of limited memory on my HTC Desire, but also because it really was convenient enough). In short, I'm quite annoyed with all the interesting stuff in the web sprawling over different accounts, so I'm glad I can unify the experience at least somewhat. With well organized boards it's well easy enough to find what I'm looking for when needed. Reply joellee March 9, 2013 at 7:50 am After what you said, I think I'm starting to see the appeal of Springpad. Unification is always a great feature of convenience and that's one of the reasons why people love Google products.

Reply Julian Altshul March 5, 2013 at 11:44 am I've never tried Catch, but I have tried the other 3 of these apps and Evernote gets my vote. One Note and Springpad are both decent but I find Evernote the easiest to use - syncing is straightforward, and the search function works well and is quick - if you have lots of notes and need to find something in a hurry. I tend to store mainly text notes and web clippings, with the odd audio note. Springpad might suit you better if you like to store more visual material. @Joel Lee and @Kelly Buchanan, I can see a lot of sense in using more than one of these apps for different purposes and I agree, Springpad looks more like a scrapbook. Reply joellee March 9, 2013 at 7:48 am Straightforwardness is a great quality and I can see why so many people, including yourself, prefer Evernote over the rest.

Catch could work for me like Evernote but Evernote's functionality suits my work style better. I like having them seperate. They both work well for me. Reply Joel Lee March 1, 2013 at 7:17 pm Springpad does feel more like a scrapbook, which is great for clipping and saving things for later (like you're doing). But I guess I have no use for that which is why I feel it's just overly complex. Good that it works for you, though. Reply Augusto March 1, 2013 at 3:16 am Some important notes about some of those tools (I tried all of them too). Evernote doesn't do offline caching in the free version of the service. Killer issue for me. Catch has a limit on the number of streams (5) in the free version. But it's the most simple to take quick notes too. Springpad, as you said, is a bit too complex. As it has multiple types of data it requires you to chose that before adding the item every time. Unnecessary complexity IMO. I use catch for simple text notes and Springpad for other stuff, like clipping content from websites and wine wish lists. Reply Joel Lee March 1, 2013 at 7:16 pm Good catch on those limitations that I missed. I think it's smart to use different apps for different purposes like you (Springpad + Catch). Nice! Reply Hari March 18, 2013 at 4:13 am It is funny how most reviews miss the Evernote limitation. It is actually surprising that the service became so popular with this huge limitation. I had it was already popular on the desktop before the mobile revolution started. I started using SpringPad because it had no such limitations on the mobile, but their chrome extension is very limited, which is huge limitation for me. E.g., you can not edit notes and the direct link to open notes on the web app had been broken for very long, so it requires many click before you can start editing it. Lately I have been using GNotes for quick note taking and log maintenance (it supports buttons to enter date and time other than automatic bulleting). It syncs with Gmail, so the notes are available readonly outside the app. I wish there is a web app to edit notes from browser.

Akshay Hallur June 4, 2013 at 7:23 pm this will help u.. hank May 30, 2013 at 1:36 am to the author of the site you need to fix lines 13 and 19. you have not ended the cod coment. its stopping the html from linking to the css Tina Sieber May 30, 2013 at 8:25 am The author of which site? TommY May 25, 2013 at 12:34 am I think there aren't actually real files on that survey sites, it's all fake... Real files would be through adf.ly or something like that, but on standard site like mediafire, rapidshare etc. cydiahelper560 July 4, 2013 at 8:19 pm Actually not. WHY? because if they upload to mediafire or rapidshare it can be public and it wouldn't work for more like 3 days. thats why they have surveys to make sure that it isn't gonna be removed or discovered by internet security guys or whatever you can call them Mrhelpfulnew May 1, 2013 at 9:21 pm Take the survey remover from SKIDROW. They are a very popular hacking group. You can get it here for free: mediafire.com/?bbv58892wmlhaq5 bmbm May 12, 2013 at 4:58 am yeah and after you open that rar they ask to complete a survey to get the password. it's just all the same PKE May 13, 2013 at 10:14 am Any way to bypass Fileice Surveys Sukanya S May 15, 2013 at 1:27 pm It seems to me there is no actual way to bypass those surveys, how sad MG June 11, 2013 at 5:35 pm You know what you get on that page? Invalid or Deleted File. The key you provided for file download was invalid. This is usually caused because the file is no longer stored on MediaFire. This occurs when the file is removed by the originating user or MediaFire. Still have questions, or think we've made a mistake? Please contact support for further assistance. Em April 29, 2013 at 7:04 am http://akshayeminem.blogspot.com/2013/04/how-to-bypass-surveys-to-download-files.html this can help you.. gav April 21, 2013 at 9:42 am this person says that he will upload the mediafire file soon http://fileicesurveykiller.blogspot.kr/2012/08/fileice-survey-killer-bypass-fileice.html Mike April 8, 2013 at 10:57 am Don't waste your time on these survey sites, even if you complete or bypass the survey you'll probably never get the promised files, just a bunch of spam and ads instead. Or how about a nice piece of spyware, a virus or a costly monthly subscription to an online service you'll never use ? These people earn money by enticing the greedy, the dishonest and the gullible to submit their mobile phone number or an email address. When someone says to you \"Hey, tell me your name and I'll give you a million dollars\", do you believe them? Hmm... I thought not. You might also try being honest and stop trying to get something for nothing (ie stealing). Much safer and a lot cheaper in the long run. You'll sleep better at night. Anne Ahnomus April 18, 2013 at 10:43 pm Actually, there is a legitimate need to bypass these survey sites. Some files (listed as free) are only available from such sites. Can't find them anywhere else, even if I'd be willing to pay!! For example: http://hackersuniversity.com/the-sims-freeplay-hack-cheats-trainer-tool.html Find that item on a non-survey site. Some say they don't require surveys, but after the download, it requires a password to unlock the zip or rar - and to get the password, guess what? Yep, you have to visit a survey site. Alan Wade March 5, 2013 at 12:51 pm I have got to go with MUO TechGuy's response, its by far the easiest route! pratyush March 4, 2013 at 1:00 pm just go to http://survey-remover.com/ and get the bookmarklet and skip survey Anonymous March 5, 2013 at 5:30 pm well that used to work before, but they don't work now. the survey makers also got smarter, i think. Muo TechGuy March 4, 2013 at 9:07 am Stop using such pathetic sites, and switch to torrents or Usenet. Herobrine August 2, 2013 at 5:20 pm I agree that torrents can get you pretty much ANYTHING without surveys but they are just a big of a pain in the ass. Sukanya S August 7, 2013 at 6:23 am How can torrents help? i don't use torrent much coz i don't know much about them. MakeUseOf TechGuy August 7, 2013 at 8:11 am (1) Get a torrent client (2) Go to piratebay.org (3) Enjoy. I do not condone piracy, just education! susendeep dutta March 3, 2013 at 6:31 am Try the web service in the below link - http://surveybypass.com/ Surveys are used by many to earn money from it.

Choose food items with a long shelf life, such as canned goods and packaged pantry items. Opt for items that don t require refrigeration, but also those that require little cooking in case you don t have power due to a disaster. Store 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water per person (and per pet) per day. Don t forget formula and bottles if you have an infant, as well as pet food for any pets. [9] Tap water may be unsafe to drink in the event of a disaster, so be sure to include plenty of purified water in bottles or jugs. Canned soup, tuna, nuts, dried fruit, beef jerky, nut butter, protein bars, cereal, powdered milk, dry pasta, and packaged crackers are good options. Don t forget to pack a can opener, utensils, dishes, waterproof matches, and a camp stove, if possible. At the minimum you should have a 3 day supply of food and water ready, but it s best to store enough for 2 weeks. Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 9 2 Include clothing, shoes, and toiletries. Pack a 3-day supply of clothing (including multiple layers), socks, and an extra pair of shoes for each member of the family. Toiletries, like soap, shampoo, feminine products, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and deodorant should also be included. Add diapers and wipes if you have small children. [10] Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 10 3 Add shelter and safety supplies. Pack emergency blankets, sleeping bags, and a tent or two in case you can t stay in your home. A multipurpose tool (like a knife/file/pliers/screwdriver combo), and a whistle would also be handy to have in your kit. [11] Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 11 4 Pack electronics and batteries. Include several flashlights, an AM/FM radio, and extra batteries. You may also want to include a prepaid cell phone with a charger in case your landline or cell phone doesn t work during a natural disaster. [12] Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 12 5 Include medicine and a first aid kit. Prescription and over-the-counter medicines should be included in your kit. Add a basic first aid kit containing instant ice packs, bandages, antiseptic ointment, scissors, tape, a suture kit, and so on. Pack extra glasses or contact lenses and solution, and any other medical supplies that may be needed, like a cane or hearing aids with extra batteries. [13] You may want to include a field medicine handbook as well as a veterinary medicine handbook if you have pets. [14] Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 13 6 Add cash, maps, and spare keys. It s a good idea to store some cash in your emergency kit. Add a mix of small and large bills in case the banks or ATMs are closed. You should also include maps of the area as well as a spare house and car key. [15] Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 14 7 Store the kit in a cool, dry place. To make sure your food and water last as long as possible, don t store your kit near direct sunlight, excess moisture, or fluctuating temperatures. The ideal temperature range is from 40 to 70 F (4 to 21 C). While bathrooms and kitchens aren t great options, basements and closets will do just fine. [16] You may choose to prepare a second kit and store it in your car, if desired. Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 15 8 Put important papers in a fireproof and waterproof lockbox. Important papers could be lost in a natural disaster, so fill the box with copies of each family member s ID as well as birth certificates, passports, deeds, and titles. You could also include insurance paperwork, immunization records, and a copy of your family emergency plan. Add a list of phone numbers and addresses for family members and other important contacts, too. [17] Keep both the box and key in your emergency kit. Alternatively, you can scan important documents and store them on memory stick inside of a waterproof container in your kit. Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 16 9 Rotate the items regularly. To ensure the clothes and shoes fit and the food and medicine aren t expired, you should rotate out the items every year or two. Purchase new supplies for your packs and use the existing supplies for your day to day needs. [18] Advertisement", "url": "https://www.wikihow.com/Be-Prepared-for-Natural-Disasters", "index": 0}

This represents the never-ending struggle between the pursuant rectangular form and chased arrowhead. It also represents tapping a button to perform an action, which is more applicable in this case. So tap this button. If you managed to tap that button successfully, you ll have a few options. The one you want to tap is Add to Home Screen . So do that.

Reply Jaroslaw Jasinski August 13, 2012 at 6:40 pm I am a student (like my e-mail suggests) the second year of Computer Science and I would like to volunteer and participate in the competition for this wonderful device, which is this drive. This disc would be a fantastic option for me, what I would like to include in your new laptop. For me, this drive would be a fantastic solution due to the fact that I would not have to worry that I could lose their data, through damage to the laptop, another reason she could be the speed of system startup. I was very pleased by my system as urchomi? be as fast as he could. Also, I could very quickly compile your programs. So I think this drive was saved by me through the whole period of study. Therefore, I appeal to much to ask to you to convince you my comments to myself and that I could be the winner. But of course there are many people who have the same hope. So I wish you all good luck. Best Regards Jarek.

Make sure all of your the customers you will be including on your list, have given you specific permission to send your email marketing to them. Image titled Send Your First Business Email Blast Step 2 2 Save your customer data to a .CVS file and make sure you include as much data as possible. Many business owners just upload email addresses. However, email marketing services offer advanced custom \"merge tags\" that allow you to personalize your emails with customer names, birth dates, anniversary dates, addresses, and more. If you don't include this information in your data merge, you won't be able to personalize your emails as much as you might like. Image titled Send Your First Business Email Blast Step 3 3 Upload your customer data file to your email marketing provider. Many providers allow free accounts, with limited services and a limitation on the number of emails you will be allowed to send. For instance: Mail Chimp allows free accounts for any database size under 2000 customers. Image titled Send Your First Business Email Blast Step 4 4 Design your email. Make sure you use crisp graphics and sharp logos. Use colors that match your brand. Keep your message under 200 words. Do not try to cram to much into your message. The rule should be: If the reader can't figure out what the email is about in less than 7 seconds, they will probably delete it. Your image, headline and first sentence should be \"on target\" with what your email is about. Image titled Send Your First Business Email Blast Step 5 5 Stay on point. Don't waste the very limited real estate in your email template to go on and on about who and now great you are, or that this is your first email, or talking about how they can unsubscribe, etc. If you can answer \"yes\" to one or more of these questions, you have a great chance at retaining your subscribers after your first email (and well beyond). Ask several people you know to answer these questions honestly before you send your email and treat their feedback as gold. Am I offering something of value that my customers would never get in my normal advertising or promotions? Am I providing education to the customer that they would never get, or think of looking for, on their own? Am I offering something entertaining, humorous, insider information with class and exceptionally good taste? Is the email content focused only on my customer (not at all focused on \"me\")? Am I giving my customers choices to \"link\" to my social pages and website? Did I establish that future emails will be \"valuable\" and infrequent? Image titled Send Your First Business Email Blast Step 6 6 Test send your final draft to yourself and your staff (only). Make sure you open the test draft version on a big computer monitor, a small monitor, a tablet (iPad), a smartphone (Android, iPhone) and in different browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc). The recipients of your emails are using all sorts of browsers and devices. Make sure your email looks good on all of them. Image titled Send Your First Business Email Blast Step 7 7 Use links wisely. Make sure you include links to your website and social networking pages (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc). Make sure all hyperlinks on your email are set to open in a new page so recipients are not pulled away from the email before they are done reading it. Image titled Send Your First Business Email Blast Step 8 8 Read federal \"CAN SPAM\" laws (or your local equivalent). Make sure you are compliant. Abusing \"CAN SPAM\" laws, even unintentionally, can lead to your IP address being blocked from sending emails [1] . Your email marketing provider is always monitoring your compliance. Don't take any chances! Image titled Send Your First Business Email Blast Step 9 9 Be cautious. If you are not confident that your first email meets all of the above standards, do not send it. Start over or find a marketing professional with email marketing expertise to help you, at least for your first launch. This is the most important email you will ever send. Image titled Send Your First Business Email Blast Step 10 10 Double check everything. Select the day and time that your email is most likely to be seen, opened and read. Then go for it, and click send! Advertisement", "url": "https://www.wikihow.com/Send-Your-First-Business-Email-Blast", "index": 0}

So kindly check out with the vendor. However, if you have a model without Google Play, you can try this : We have lot of similar low cost Android 4.0 ICS tablets in which the manufacturers do not give access to Google Play. My friend brought one such tablet from HCL (a Indian brand) known as the HCL ME U1 tablet. Yesterday we successfully installed and accessed the android marketplace on it without doing any rooting or custom ROM stuff or anything so the warranty on the device is intact. You can give it a shot. First search Google and download these APK files : 1. GoogleServicesFramework-signed 2. OneTimeInitializer-signed 3. SetupWizard-signed 4. com.android.vending-3.1.3-signed (For this last one you can try the latest Google Play Store APK file, though I haven t tried it myself, so not sure if it will work or not, the one suggested here is a old version, which has been tested and tried and works) Once you have done that, go to your tablet setting and enable Unknown sources under security. Now tap and install the four APKs mentioned above in the exact sequence mentioned (this is very important and need to be followed). Once you have installed the four APKs, un-tick the Unknown Sources option under security in Settings and then reboot your tablet. The start-up process will take much more time now (in some cases upto 45 minutes) and once it is completed, a small window will come-up with the option of a launcher and setup wizard. First tick the below dialogue which says always use this as default and then select the launcher. Now you should find the android market icon in the app drawer or work-space. Enable your internet connection and tap it. First I will ask you for a Google Account. If you already have a GMail account, select existing or otherwise select new to create one. Once you have finished this step, you should logically have an access to the Google Play Store. Kindly give a feedback of how did it go. This at-least worked for my friend s tablet and he is a very happy man now.

The whole point of those is to actually load the page in the background so that by the time you click on the page, it's fully loaded and ready to be read. Firefox beta merely adds the page to the browser. The loading happens after yo have switched to the browser. Which totally defeats the purpose. Maybe the feature is not complete yet. But as it stands, it's nor replacing LinkBubble and is pretty useless. Reply Anonymous October 3, 2015 at 1:10 pm I would suggest getting linkbubble especially since its now free.I suppose its somewhat like tab queuing.

It's a simple thing that can be so useful. Reply Mihir Patkar October 1, 2015 at 7:33 am I know, right? About damn time, Mozilla Reply Anonymous September 29, 2015 at 6:28 pm I've never found Chrome for Android to be a particularly compelling browser. Android actually has a lot of good browsing options and there's no One True Browser for it any more than there is on Windows or OSX. Android Chrome is somewhat crashy and seems to eat a lot of RAM. I also notice more rendering defects in it than on Firefox or Dolphin. The only real reason I keep it on most Android devices is that a certain percentage of mobile web developers entirely equate mobile browsing with Webkit a rendering engine and don't fail as gracefully as I might like. Fennec (Firefox for Android) has an image problem in that it doesn't have much in the way of marketing, doesn't ship as a default product on anything and the biggest reasons for using it amount to third party addons anyway. I think it's faster and less crashy, but I also wouldn't bother with that if not for Ad blocking and Ghostery support (and Flash, I guess. Maybe. For somebody). I don't know if it needs to have vastly wider adoption on Android, or if growth in Fennec usage would just lead to greater abandonment of developer work on the desktop Firefox product. I also know that I see more Mobile IE traffic than I see Fennec browser sessions in the logs on the web sites I manage. It's very much a niche product. In closing, all contemporary web browsers across all platforms are to some greater or lesser degree unsatisfactory and it is probably best to consider each of them as a tool for a particular set of needs rather than the be all and end all of web usage. Reply Mihir Patkar September 30, 2015 at 6:48 am Fennec actually had this feature for some time, but right now, FF seems to be doing better as an overall browser than Fennec. I tried Fennec for this review and was disappointed, compared to FF. Your thoughts? Reply Anonymous September 29, 2015 at 4:21 pm Ah, the good old tl;dr.

The issue I have is knowing that emails have arrived without having to scroll down the labels on the left side, looking for indicators of arrived, unread mail. I have left Skip the Inbox (Archive it) unchecked and had assumed that email would be delivered to both the labelled folder and Inbox. However, this is not happening and emails are delivered to labels without appearing in the Inbox. Any suggestions? Reply Akshata Shanbhag October 29, 2018 at 2:21 pm Alex, as long as you have left the Skip the Inbox and Mark as Read boxes unchecked, you should see the unread emails in the inbox and under the assigned label. If that isn't working, maybe you can try selecting the Always mark it as important option while creating the filter. Ensure that you've enabled Show markers under Settings > Inbox Reply Bill March 30, 2018 at 4:00 pm I appreciate the help I am getting but there are still unresolved questions in my mind. How do I select mail that is \"to,\" \"from, \" or \"cc\" to a specific address, or any combination of the three. I can see that if I put the address in the \"from\" box, it will select messages from that address. But how do I select messages that are sent TO an address other than mine? Or cc'ed to an address other than mine? T'bird offers 13 different criteria (subject, body, to, from, etc. etc.) and 6 different conditions (contains, doesn't contain, is, etc. etc.) I can enter multiple criteria and conditions and require that any of them or all of them be met. Gmail seems to permit only a few criteria (from, subject, does or doesn't contain, etc.) What is the point of the \"to\" box. It would seem to me that the only use for this would be if I have two e-mail addresses and want to sort in address A depending upon whether a copy had been sent to B. Reply Akshata Shanbhag March 31, 2018 at 4:53 am You can use the OR filter in the Has the words box like this: to:your_name@gmail.com OR to:another_name@gmail.com Any criteria that work in the search box should also work in the Has the words field in the filter. Since you get prompts for filter attributes in the search box as you start typing, it's easier to copy-paste conditions from there into the filter. Reply Bill Wilkes June 27, 2018 at 12:34 am Akshata, It has been a while since I started trying to use Gmail, and I have solved some of my problems with Thunderbird, so I am not so eager to move to Gmail. However, I have not given up, and I am continuing to try to do more.. I really miss the ability to have multiple criteria that Thunderbird provides, because making filters to sort out mail that is either from or to or cc'd to Joe, Sam, and Bob still seems to require a bunch of filters instead of just one. But my bigger problem is trying to get ANY filter to work as the filters in Thunderbird do. I would think that if I create a filter that says label any message from Bob@abc.net , \"Bob,\" that every new message that comes in from Bob would receive the Bob label. The messages just pile up in the inbox. The filter doesn't work until I open Gmail and \"edit\" the Bob filter. I don't actually change anything, but when I click on \"save\", all of the accumulated messages from Bob will be given the Bob label. I don't understand the purpose of filters if they only work when I have the Gmail app open. Reply Akshata Shanbhag June 28, 2018 at 1:33 pm That sounds strange. I haven't had trouble with Gmail filters the way you have described. Yes, they will still appear in the inbox if you don't choose the Archive checkbox while creating/editing the filter. But the labeling should work even if you don't have the app open. Anyway, since Thunderbird is working quite well for you, it makes sense to stick to that. Bill March 20, 2018 at 11:59 pm I suppose this would work if the instructions agreed with reality. ,1, I don't have a picture on my Gmail. 2 I do have a couple of avatars on the page, but there is no \"settings\" symbol near either of them. 3 there is a settings gear farther down the page, but clicking on it takes me to the tablet accounts page, where there is no link to \"filters and blocked addresses\". There is no link to anything with the word \"filter\" in it. Reply Akshata Shanbhag March 21, 2018 at 12:09 pm Hi Bill, which device are you using? Reply Bill March 23, 2018 at 2:23 am That was an Android device because I am trying to minimize my use of Windows. I did discover later that the instructions you gave DO work when one opens Gmail in Windows. I hope when I finally get used to it, I will find the same ability to filter mail that I have in Thunderbird. It appears that I can, but what I liked about Thunderbird filters is that you can select several criteria and then whether the mail must meet any of them or all of them. E.g., only messages from Joe with an attachment or only messages before or after a certain date. Reply Bill March 23, 2018 at 3:17 am I have another question. In Thunderbird, my filters generally move a message to a specific folder. Messages from Joe go to the Joe folder. In GMail, all I can do is to apply a label or a category. I don't understand categories, but I do see familiar folders in the choice of labels. However, the message is now in both the folder and the inbox. Does \"skip inbox\" PLUS \"add label A\" mean \"move the message to folder A?\" Move the message seems so much clearer - I have no idea why I would want a bunch of labels scattered among the 200 messages in my inbox. Also, I want all messages from Joe's Glass company AND all messages from anyone with glass in the subject OR in the body OR both to be moved to the glass folder. I've tried putting \"glass\" in the \"from box, in the \"subject\" box , in the \"has words\" box, but nothing seems to work. Do I have to spell out Joe's Glass Co@abc.com , or can I just put in Joe or Joe's glass or Joe's Glass Co? Also, there is a box for \"subject\" and another for \"has the words.\" Does the subject have to be exact? Or can it simply be required to include a word? What does the \"has the words\" box mean. Does that mean has the words in the body? in the subject? either? Take a look at Thunderbird and how to create a filter - it is quite transparent and easy. I never once had a problem trying to create a filter, but I'm just groping around with Gmail. Reply Akshata Shanbhag March 25, 2018 at 2:36 pm Bill, in Gmail labels sort of double up as folders and tags. \"Skip inbox\" + \"Add label A\" does move the email to the folder A as you guessed. Once it does, you will the see the message when you open folder A, but you won't see the label \"A\" itself in the message list. You'll see it if you open the email. Now, if you leave the message in the inbox and add the label \"A\" to it, you'll see the email in the inbox and folder A, but in the inbox it will be labeled \"A\", and in the folder A it will be labeled \"inbox\". I guess this approach comes in handy when you view emails the All Mail folder, which contains sent messages, drafts, and trash items apart from incoming messages. Categories make it easier to filter personal messages from automated ones, messages sent to a mailing list, etc. For example, if you get a password reset email, you're sure to find it under the Updates category. Marketing emails show up under Promotions and Facebook/Twitter messages show up under Social. As for creating the filters you mention, the From field is reserved for a sender's email address. The To field is for an email address that belongs to you i.e. if you check multiple accounts from Gmail. This is why putting in \"glass\" in the From/To field won't work. You'll need to create two separate filters here: one where the From field contains the email Joe's Glass Co@abc.com and the second where you put \"glass\" in the Has the words field. The Subject field is only for the subject and it doesn't have to be exact i.e. it can simply include a word or a set of words in a particular sequence. The Has the words box filters words that are either in the subject and/or body of the email. Thunderbird does make filter creation easy, but really, it's not so bad in Gmail either once you get the hang of it. Julija January 29, 2018 at 9:51 am Hello, I do not understand how fill in the box Filter \"has the words\"?? If I write one word - it works, but how do I separate a few words? Using a space, comma or dash ... - does not work. Gmail filters out only the first word. Please help me. Thank you. Reply Akshata Shanbhag January 30, 2018 at 3:06 am You can filter multiple words or phrases with AND/OR operators. If you type in a few words without using one of these operators, Gmail considers the sequence as an exact phrase and searches for it specifically as it appears. Reply Anonymous April 14, 2016 at 11:08 pm \"To Auto-delete Emails That Just Don t Quit\" That is only a partial solution. You are moving the clutter from Inbox to Trash. Google should add an option that if an email matches the filter, it is spam. Reply Akshata Shanbhag April 16, 2016 at 2:40 am That would have been convenient, but for now we're stuck with blocking senders to mark their mails as spam or auto-deleting mails. The latter is a partial solution. I prefer it because I don't use the All Mail label much, so the deleted emails stay out of sight and I can empty the trash once in a while. Reply Anonymous April 14, 2016 at 6:09 pm I don't understand \"inbox zero.\" I keep all my messages - every one I've ever gotten over the last 25 years, in my primary inbox. I can mark them important if I need to, and the chronology of when they were delivered helps me assemble a journal of my day. Reply Akshata Shanbhag April 16, 2016 at 2:42 am I guess it depends on how you see your inbox. You see it as a sort of journal, while people like myself who maintain an empty inbox see it as a to-do list.

While you can call any Skype user in the world for free through Skype, you'll need to pay if you want to use Skype to call a mobile or landline number.

Skype charges based on where you are calling to , not where you are calling from . You can no longer make calls from Skype in India to phones also in India. You can still make Skype-to-Skype calls for free. [1] Image titled Use Mobile Skype Step 19 2 Decide between pay-as-you-go or a subscription. Skype offers two forms of payment: you can buy a set amount of Skype credit, which your minutes will be subtracted from based on the per-minute rate for the country you're calling, or you can purchase different monthly subscriptions that offer set amounts or unlimited minutes. You can purchase subscriptions and credit through the Skype app or through the Skype website. There are subscriptions that are country-specific, and there is the Skype Worldwide subscription. The Worldwide subscription offers unlimited minutes to any number in the world for $13.99 USD per month (as of February 2015). Depending on the country you are calling, you may be able to get an unlimited subscription specific to that country for less.

You can also tap the \"Address Book\" button in the upper-right corner to search through your contacts. Image titled Use Mobile Skype Step 21 4 Start the call.

Reply Tamie Hamilton-Lavoie July 24, 2017 at 6:09 pm the simpler the interface, the better, really Reply Tamie Hamilton-Lavoie July 24, 2017 at 6:35 pm You know what would make Keep just that much better? (I've mentioned this elsewhere, but I'm going to keep trying...) It would be *awesome* if I could import a pinterest board into Keep, edit it, and re-upload it. The last step is actually optional. I have a number of boards where the whole pinterest board is just for one project, and they look nice, and are convenient to save to as I'm researching something, but in the actual making of the item, they're very inconvenient and keep is much better there. It would also be terrific if the words could wrap around the graphics. Imagine, if you will, a board or collection of pinterest pins that are all about creating a kitchen herb garden, and all the ways that different people believe is *the best way*. One with notes and illustrations from the book \"Square Foot Gardening\" that you've scanned from your copy, and a pins with photos & illustrations of your fav herbs, with notes about the best places to source your seeds and sprouts. And, maybe a few pins about tomatoes, a couple about composting. A couple of days or even weeks, before you buy your bags of earth, lumber, shovels, etc; you sit down and look at the pins and make a plan. You can see pretty clearly at this point how hard it is to do a \"step 1, step 2... \" kind of plan from pins directly. They're pretty, but all the text is sort of behind the pictures. With keep, the opposite is true - all the text is \"in front\" with a collection of links at the bottom to the pix. They both come very close to being electronic index cards.

Shaun Sanders February 13, 2013 at 4:24 pm log out DrSunil Vaswani February 8, 2013 at 5:09 am hullo Does the app run in background because of Gps use? So if one can avoid app from accessing gps it would not run in background Pl comment what would be result of avoiding gps access and how to Nevzat Akkaya February 13, 2013 at 12:08 pm I don't think it's related to GPS access. It's irrelevant. Some programs have Android services so that they remain connected to their web services and receive notifications. I too have a phone with a very limited RAM, so I stopped using Facebook application, I'm using it's mobile interface via browsers like Dolphin, Maxthon... This way, when you exit from browser, no any RAM eater process or service is left. Nevzat Akkaya February 13, 2013 at 12:10 pm Correction : Android services are not just for connecting to web services. There are many usage scenarios for them :) DrSunil Vaswani February 13, 2013 at 3:47 pm Is there a way to avoid fb app from occuping memory after exiting the app Nevzat Akkaya February 13, 2013 at 3:55 pm Sorry but there is no easy way to do it. I have only one solution for it : freeze the Facebook app via Titanium Backup. Only this way bot the process and services can be shut down. The drawback is, everytime you want to start Facebook, you must unfreeze the app, use it, and freeze again. It's time consuming. Just use the browser interface like I do. That's the only simple solution. DrSunil Vaswani February 13, 2013 at 6:53 pm App would be preferable for notifications But it is noticed to automatically re-starts within few minutes after stopping it from running in background even if there are no notifications Can it be prevented from restarting without notifications?

Ashwin Ramesh February 6, 2013 at 3:08 am There are certain apps like RAM Booster and Advanced Task Killer Pro to kill apps. You could check them out. DalSan Mack February 7, 2013 at 12:14 am I have used several task killers including what you suggested to no avail. Friendcaster allows you to kill the task and it won't restart as often or as quickly as the Facebook app. It would be nice to have the option to disable refreshing and updating in the settings, but I doubt that will happen any time soon. DrSunil Vaswani February 8, 2013 at 5:12 am hullo Does the app run in background because of Gps use So if one can avoid app from accessing gps it would not run in background DalSan Mack February 6, 2013 at 2:41 am Hello DrSunil, As long as you have the Facebook app installed and are using it from time to time, there is no real way to stop it from running. If you don't use it, I would uninstall it. If it cannot be uninstalled, you would need to have your phone rooted so you can use a program like Titanium Backup to \"freeze\" the app or uninstall it. The Facebook app constantly starts up in the background to try to connect with the Facebook servers so you can receive News Feed updates and such. No matter which task killer you use, it will not help in keeping the app killed. An alternative to the Facebook app would be Friendcaster for android, which I use. It offers pretty much everything you would want in a Facebook app, but you can also kill the app in the background and it won't restart as often. DrSunil Vaswani February 8, 2013 at 5:08 am hullo Does the app run in background because of Gps use? So if one can avoid app from accessing gps it would not run in background DalSan Mack February 8, 2013 at 5:37 am It isn't so much that it keeps connecting to the GPS for location as it is trying to keep you informed of any status updates, new comments, likes, and requests. It would be nice to turn off these features as we would like and have it more like going through the web browser and only connect when we actually use it. Sunil February 8, 2013 at 8:41 am I understand I used to use an app named Scope for fb It also notified of status, messages , friend requests. But it did not automatically run in background Devon Truscott February 9, 2013 at 10:50 pm It's probably because that app was set up for push notifications from a facebook plugin. Another reason why facebook runs in the background is because it ties itself to your contact list. If anyone changes their contact info, it updates it in your contacts. It can't get pushed this information so it has to check on its own.", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/answers/how-can-i-keep-facebooks-mobile-app-from-automatically-running-in-the-background/", "index": 0}

I would like to see the data just for the performance, let alone build quality and software features which are both considered very subjective to the eye of the beholder. This article is, frankly, quite biased and full of claims that shows how much the author favors the LG G Pad 8.3. \"The fact that the G Pad packs only a 5-megapixel camera doesn t impact the quality of the shot in the slightest.\" The author just typed it was a mediocre rear-facing camera a few lines before, now he's contradicting himself by typing that it doesn't impact shots quality by the slightest? There are a few more statements that I could point out, but putting that aside, I hope that articles like this can be improved in quality in the future, especially for a tech-blog like MakeUseOf. P.S.: Giveaways are always awesome though~ Reply Kannon Y May 2, 2014 at 4:55 pm This is actually excellent criticism as those exact two points were ones that I agonized over. Thank you Joses for taking the time to write. If you have additional points that need revision, I would greatly appreciate your input. The Snapdragon 600 is basically a low-cost tablet chipset (which is also used in a few phones) which offers good performance. Its real world performance at FHD resolutions is good, but it's definitely not the best. I should have emphasized that what makes the G Pad such a great device is its multifunctionality (the IR transmitter + software suite), build quality and great value. Regarding the camera, I need to make it clearer that the new Google Camera app available in Android 4.4 allows for surprisingly good shots to be taken, despite the weak 5MP camera. When time permits, I'll make those changes. Thanks again for the feedback! Reply Joses L May 3, 2014 at 3:12 pm I see, but your statement there sounds like it is the best tablet ever made in 2013 and 2014 regardless of price target market, which is of course far from the case. I would also like to point out that even the software feature doesn't seem all that great, those points that you made were: - Tablet Optimized Soft Keyboard, yet it didn't feature swyping, which is built-in for standard Android Keyboard from Jelly Bean onwards. The only difference is the number row, which, again, can be input from standard Android Keyboard anyway. - KnockON: This is a good feature, but it's not exclusive to LG, since some devices from the Xperia line also has tap2wake implemented. - Voice Mate: Google Now>Siri, so if Voice Mate<Siri, then it's obviously a failure and just another gimmick from LG... - Quicl Remote: Not enough info, but seems to simplistic to \"exceed all comptet. Which reinforces my point about how the G Pad isn't anything special at all, but IMHO still good enough for its price point(and this should be emphasized more). And I don't know why you would put plastic as better than metal. \"Normally metal components of tablets serve as heat sinks, but the G Pad uses the plastic as its primary place to transfer thermal energy.\" \" For example, after extended periods of gaming, the tablet only becomes warm to the touch. Its coolness owes in part to the aluminum backing, which doubles as a heat sink for the torrid Snapdragon 600 chipset.\" Another contradiction there, you said the G Pad primarily uses plastic to conduct heat, but then again say it can stay cool because of the aluminium back? I don't think there is any kind of plastic that is more conductive to aluminium, even thermally conductive polymer(although not sure about this one), but clearly aluminium conducts heat better than your average plastic. It worries me if a writer in a well-known blog site like MakeUseOf needs a reader to point out some obvious logical flaws in the written article. Where is the editor for this kind of thing? And even without a separate editor, I wonder if the writer is truly qualified to write about tech in MUO at all. Or if the writer doesn't really care because this is just a giveaway, and most people is just eager to get the stuff(which is largely true...). No offense there, and it's too late to change most of the stuff anyway.

Adios Reply Leo April 18, 2018 at 1:52 am I hard bricked my Huawei P10 VTR-L09 by trying to flash an update through TWRP, I ended up deleting my \"system\" database by mistake and had not made a backup. It is totally my own mistake, but now my phone is wiped clean and I would like to use it for software development but Huawei have their way of making bricked phones unusable. Reply Kavish Bansal April 21, 2019 at 1:25 am How did you do it, even I flashed wromg TWRP I think, but now it is stuck on first boot screen. PC doesn't recognises it, and can't get into any recovery modes listed. Please help. Reply Phone Phreak April 16, 2018 at 6:47 am There really is no such thing as a \"Soft Brick\" , its known as a boot loop and you can always get your phone into download mode at this point in time so its not really a brick yet, when you have bricked your phone its dead and I mean dead, its mostly caused by flashing a wrong boot loader and the phone has no way to even turn on so you now have a bricked phone. Some phones like Samsung use a usb dongle (jig) to get into download mode (hardware feature built in) so you can flash the proper firmware and the phone comes back to life, if you have a hardware failure then your not going anywhere so its now a expensive paper weight for your desk. Hardware failures are less common than a brick compared to them damn boot loops when flashing custom roms.

Reply KONDANI Sukumar September 26, 2017 at 1:26 pm Hlo. I firstly used TWRP 3.0.2-2 . And istalled AOSP for my Lenovo k3 note. As it had some bugs I thought to flash Super RR custom rom by Jdesing. I tried to flash the rom through the same version of twrp recovery. Error 7 occurred. I searched on Google about error 7 and I came to know it happens because of fake version of TWRP. So again backup my previous data and installed Flashify app and flashed TWRP 3.1. and it prompted for 'Flashing Complete' 'reboot'. I rebooted. And its stuck in bootlooping. And as for my fate, I didn't enable USB Debugging before doing all that. Can anyone please tell me what to do now?

When you start video chat, your image is small in the top right corner, and the other party is on the main screen, full screen. To swap the images - say you want to see more clearly the piece of paper you are showing them - simply tap on the small image, and the 2 images will swap. Tap it again to swap back.

Usually this is about 6:00 PM. By the time everybody gets there, it'll most likely be 6:40 or something, so it'll be dark and perfect for horror. 2 Play some ghost games. You want it to be SCARY and full of FRIGHT, right? Play Bloody Mary or do a s ance. A s ance is where you get a candle, gather together in a circle and connect each other by holding hands, then light the candle and put it the middle of circle. Then, you choose someone to call a ghost from the other world. Maybe if somebody wants to contact their grandmother, say, \"Grandmother Maria, we awaken you from the other world to speak to you. Please show us a sign of your presence.\" Or, \"Anita Josephs, we awaken you from the dead.\" Or just say a deceased persons name ten times. If a s ance seems too scary, try a Ouija Board. All you have to do is get a picture of the Ouija Board from Google and copy down the stuff on it to a blank piece of paper, get a bottle cap, hold it down and call a spirit, and they will talk to you through the letters. Image titled Have a Scary Halloween Sleepover Step 3 3 Tell scary stories. Nothing is better than a cold, frightening story that will leave you with chills. If you don't know any, go online and look for scary stories to read. 4 Watch scary movies. A good example of movies would be Dead Silence, Bloody Mary, etc. If you have Netflix, choose from movies in the Horror Movies section. Image titled Have a Scary Halloween Sleepover Step 5 5 Require Sleeping Bags. This is an important step. Where will your guests sleep? Sure, a couch MIGHT work, but when you wake up your neck will hurt! Make sure you have some extra blanket to make a bed for those who don't have a sleeping bag. Image titled Have a Scary Halloween Sleepover Step 6 6 Pull a prank on your guests. During the night, wake up and whisper into each guests ear their names. To add the scary effect, trail your fingers up their arms so they think the ghost is there and ready to take them down. Image titled Have a Scary Halloween Sleepover Step 7 7 Set up some good food. You can get some Halloween recipes online. It'll really be great. Image titled Have a Scary Halloween Sleepover Step 8 8 Play truth or dare. It completes EVERY slumber party, no matter what. But this time, do the SCARY VERSION. Dare them to go outside with a flashlight for a minute all by themselves. Dare them to stay in a dark room alone while you whisper from the outside their name. Truth them if they believe in ghosts, truth them if they have ever had a scary encounter, etc. Image titled Have a Scary Halloween Sleepover Step 9 9 Play some scary music. Whether it's from your phone, laptop, etc. just play whatever! Or, you could play some classics like This Is Halloween. The BEST scary music is on youtube. Just search Coraline Soundtrack, click a song and let it play. It'll set an eerie feeling. Image titled Have a Scary Halloween Sleepover Step 10 10 Dine on candy!

Reply Dr. Michael Ecker August 18, 2019 at 2:02 am Article ignores the fact that some Windows 7 copying is superior. Example: Copying a single file to a destination that has a file with the same name. In Win 10, you have to click again for more information to help you decide about whether to replace or not. In Windows 7, you see right away the file information, including the dates, without having to click again. Insofar as many users, myself included, most often copy a single file, I consider this a great advantage of Windows 7 and a HUGE deficiency of Windows 10. Simplistic articles that portray things just one way are not as great a service as the author or publisher may think. Come on! Give us pros AND cons. Reply Me December 18, 2019 at 10:48 pm I find that using the programme Everything that transfers are instantaneous. If there is a duplicate name in target directory it informs and you make the decision to copy or not. If you don't change the name it puts a suffix on the transferring file... eg. 1 or (1) etc. Leaves Teracopy for dead. Totally in my experience. Reply Me February 6, 2020 at 5:41 pm I agree completely Dr., Windows 7 was much faster copy files. By the time click all the windows and Windows 10's stupid little graph comes up Windows 7 would have copied the files already.

I used to use Ycopy with Windows 7 to avoid the dreaded Windows file copy stopping if there was a problem.

Windows does not provide multi threaded transfer nor do your softwares listed here! I was looking for a multi threaded file transfer software, then my friend suggested me to try GS Richcopy 360.

But none of them provided me the proper and exact solution for copying huge files, until I found GS Richcopy. This software is just awesome, it provided me all the features that I wanted plus it had many extra features too. It provided me long path name support which is necessary when copying huge files, copying locked files, multi threaded file transfer for fast transfer speed, pre scheduled file transfer and many others. Try it, it never disappoints! Reply Mia lee May 16, 2017 at 6:24 pm Nice article but I would like to suggest you a really simple method. Just use GS Richcopy 360, I have been using it for almost an year. I'm very relaxed because of it, it is multi threaded so it can copy files faster than other file copying software. Not only that, I can even schedule my files for copying. It sends me an email when the transfer is done. Its amazing, all in one software by Guru Squad. Try it, hope it helps you all too!

That's GS Richcopy 360, this software is a masterpiece of how software can be simple to use and yet very powerful. This is a highly recommended software for my side( and my colleagues too). When it comes to copying files faster this software has multi threaded file transfer which makes file transfer super fast. Try it, hope this helps!

Reply Alanah Frank April 13, 2017 at 9:39 am Forget teracopy I have used it earlier and it does not provide long path names. When it comes to copying loads of file you need that feature. After searching a lot I found that GS RichCopy 360 provides that. It is simple to use and it uses multi threading file transfer to speed up the process. I would recommend it to you all. Reply anon February 8, 2018 at 5:43 am Teracopy has had long filenames for many years. Version 2.3 is highly recommended. However, for the moment I advise staying away from version 3. v3 has issues copying over networks: the speed fluctuates wildly when copying large files, and when copying groups of files, it sometimes stalls for unknown reason, and sometimes also triggers Explorer to rescan the remote directory before it can resume. Reply ArKay February 11, 2017 at 12:35 pm I am currently moving data from a 5TB HDD to a bigger 8TB version and I've been at it FOR DAYS now. I have tried a few programs and most of them suck for that task. As long as those programs are writing to the Windows cache you achieve the 100MB/sec and up, but once the drive has to start empyting that cache to the disk, the copy operation comes down to a crawl (since it has to wait until the buffer has been emptied) and the transfer rate goes down to a few MB/sec. So up and down it goes all the time giving me an AVERAGE transfer rate of 20-30MB/sec. Even if I disable the cache in Windows it doesn't get faster, rather slower which is pretty odd. I am now using FastCopy for my task. I have been running it for the last 14 minutes and the transfer rate has been constantly somewhere between 100 and 108MB/sec. I think it doesn't use the Windows drive/write behind cache but does its own caching. In those 14 minutes I have copied 90GB. With any of the other tools I have tried it would have been 25GB at best. Reply Aaditya Singhania February 8, 2017 at 6:16 pm Obviously TeraCopy is a popular option among fast copying software, but I am highly disappointed with few problems, clashes and data loss while using this. So I would suggest to use GS RichCopy 360 for the job to be done smoothly. Hope this helped. Reply IronHand October 8, 2016 at 10:29 am It's no secret that Teracopy is quite popular when it comes to software copying. I've been a user myself, but has now been inconvenienced by several crashes/errors when transferring files. I had to do it all over again and it's really not worth for a busy individual like me. My friends suggested GS RIchCopy 360, and for several months it has been working perfectly fine for me. You might want to give it a try if you are looking for a reliable software. Hope this helped.

Reply Omstavan S July 22, 2013 at 7:13 am When using teracopy, if you happen to copy a folder containing a lot of small files, you can clearly see that the copy speed is significantly slower as compared to windows.(only when large no. of small files) Reply Jonam July 22, 2013 at 4:13 am Windows 8 already transfers files faster than any previous versions of Windows. I never understood why replace Windows Explorer, it does exact same thing as any other alternative. Reply Bam July 19, 2013 at 1:46 am I was amazed at how fast Windows 8 copies files. Pulling files off my NAS jumped to 70-80MB/s from around 35MB/s on WinXP using Teracopy. If only they'd implemented an option for queued copying like Teracopy it would have been perfect, or at the very least when pausing a file transfer in the list, have an option for the next one to automatically resume when the previous has finished. Reply 210cab8f86b89110173d345767daac0f July 18, 2013 at 5:28 pm i have been using TeraCopy for two years, but it wasnt 100% reliable, then i swtched to FastCopy, which wasnt that practical, so i tried Ultra/Super Copier and kept it. TeraCopy has nice user interface and that probably kept me using it, but it isn't reliable as others, because when you migrate hundreds of thousands files to external drive you will put priority on reliability ;) Reply Chris Reddy July 18, 2013 at 4:55 pm Last year I benchmarked 14 file copy utilities (including Windows 7 File Copy) for both small and large files and found that FastCopy was hands down the best file copy utility in terms of speed, reliability, logging, repeatability, and integration.

I copied a 2.04 GB file containing 3 MP4 files of movies from my Movies folder to it's parent folder (D:/) using 3 methods- 1. Normal Mouse based copy paste. 2. Keyboard shortcuts. 3. My own entry, the cygwin terminal. Time for copy was measured using a stopwatch app on my Android smartphone. For 1 and 2, the time was 1 minute and 1 second while from the cygwin terminal with cp -r command, it was 51 seconds. However, I couldn't remove the files using Windows (as Windows gave me errors) after copy from Cygwin and had to use it again to remove it Reply Joaquim Fonseca July 18, 2013 at 9:39 am Sometimes you can have errors related with name/path too long.

Reply Doc July 20, 2013 at 10:48 pm If copying a file by drag & drop takes a minute on your PC, and if something is being \"analized\" (lol!) for up to 30 minutes, there's something wrong with your PC or network. As far as Windows 8, I'm avoiding it like the plague because of its ugly, flat theme and the \"Metro\" interface just plain sucks. I've been using Windows since the Windows 3.11 days, and, for the most part, Windows 7 is the best yet. DosGuy September 11, 2013 at 3:49 pm I still prefer the Dos 6.22 user interface, best OS ever. Reply Howard B July 17, 2013 at 11:10 pm \"Upgrade to Windows 8\" I'll do that when the Metro interface can be turned off for good, and it has a theme that doesn't look like crud (say, a Windows 7 theme). Until then, there's TeraCopy. Reply Wepiha T July 18, 2013 at 8:32 am \"It has a theme that doesn t look like crud (say, a Windows 7 theme).\" Well spoken, I too think the Windows 7 theme is crud but that's just like, my opinion, man. I rarely see the Metro interface (start8), except for the occasional pop-in from the side when I want to connect to a wireless network - how is that different from modern operating systems like say, Android? Which is to say a lot more convenient than a window that blocks my workflow. Metro is fine in small doses and actually useful, but there goes my opinion (again). TeraCopy is fantastic regardless! Reply Howard B July 19, 2013 at 12:03 am The Windows 7 theme is a vast improvement over, say, the Windows 3.11 visual style; I prefer Windows 7 (black) theme to the Windows XP theme (which was an improvement over 95/98/ME), and I install Vishal Gupta's VistaVG Black theme on new XP machines I'm going to use. (I like the window control buttons better on 7, as well as the ability to set black titlebars). At least the window control buttons are on the correct side...I can no longer say that about Ubuntu! Reply Chris Hoffman July 31, 2013 at 1:23 am I'm still using Windows 7 myself, but I have to give Windows 8 a hat-tip for the great improvement.

Habits are the place to sit tasks that you want to encourage yourself to do but which you don't want to get thwacked for if you don't do them daily. Note that which category you put something in depends entirely on what you're trying to achieve and what you feel comfortable with. Some people find it works well for them to add some tasks as habits first (so they can experiment with getting used to the task without getting constantly thwacked for non-compliance) then switch them to dailies once they've got a bit of a momentum up. This will lose the streak value but if that matters to you, you can fix that using the 'Fix character values' tool. The other thing habits are useful for is situations that happen more often than once per day. If you want to thwack yourself every time you light up a cigarette or reward yourself for every 30 mins you spend studying then habits are the go. As someone else noted, habits can be positive, negative or both and which you want to use is up to you. For smoking you could give yourself a '-' every time you lit up, a '+' every time you wanted to light up but didn't, or both. Different approaches work for different people Reply aa December 8, 2015 at 6:36 am yyyyy Reply Justin Pot December 8, 2015 at 2:23 pm bc Reply HabitFlow November 8, 2013 at 1:35 pm Also check out this minimalist habit tracker app for Android which includes the possibility to level up on habits: http://HabitFlow.com/ Available for free on Google Play.

Reply Tyler July 16, 2013 at 9:30 pm I'm going to be working on load balancing an some server tweaks. If anyone has any issues, use beta.habitrpg.com, which uses the production database and has much lighter server load Reply normalfishhands July 16, 2013 at 9:27 pm It took me a little while to figure out what to do with the habits column, too. The key is that you don't have to have a plus and a minus on a habit. If you click on the minus while editing it it'll get grayed out and go away, leaving you with nothing but reward. This has worked really well for me, and is perfect for those things that aren't everyday essentials, but you'd like to do more of. For instance, one of my habits is to do qi gong. I don't punish myself for not doing it, but I reward myself when I do. On the other side, I have a negative-only habit for when I eat sweets. In fact, out of my 11 habits only one has both plus and minus ( go to bed before/after midnight). Another thing I'd like to throw in is how great it is to customize which days a daily repeats on. For example, I have karate Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I have a \"pack your gear\" daily that only shows up on Mondays and Wednesdays. HabitRPG is dope.

Uber operates in most major cities, but it's not available everywhere. Check https://www.uber.com/cities for a list of cities where Uber operates. Image titled Apply to Become an Uber Driver Step 2 2 Determine if you are eligible to drive. You must meet several requirements in order to even be considered as a driver for Uber: You must be 21+ with a clean driving record. You need to have at least one year of driving experience in the US, three if you are under 23. You must have a four-door vehicle with four passenger seats that is 2001 (Y/51) or newer. 2001 is the base year, and some cities will require newer models. For example, Houston requires a 2007 or newer vehicle. You must consent to and pass a background check. You must have a valid driver's license and your car must be insured in your name. Image titled Apply to Become an Uber Driver Step 3 3 Visit the Uber Driver sign up page. Open a web browser on your computer and visit get.uber.com/drive to get started. It's easiest to sign up through a computer, but you can also use the Uber Driver app and follow essentially the same process. EXPERT TIP CB Chris Batchelor Lyft & Uber Driver Chris Batchelor has been driving for Lyft since July 2017 and Uber since August 2017. He has made more than 3300 combined rides as a driver for these ride-sharing services. CB Lyft & Uber Driver Uber makes signup easy. Uber and Lyft driver Chris Batchelor says: \"You can sign up for Uber through the Uber Driver app on your phone or over the web. They do require documentation, but it's easy to take a picture of.

This will create a new Uber account for you. Make sure you enter your correct city, as there are different driver rules for different cities. If you don't have a car, you can select the I need a car option at the top of the form. Be aware that car rentals are not available in most cities. You can see the available cities at the bottom of the page you're on in the fine print. Image titled Apply to Become an Uber Driver Step 6 6 Confirm your vehicle meets your city's requirements. The first thing you'll be asked is if your vehicle meets the requirements for your city. If it does, click Continue . If it doesn't, you won't be able to use that vehicle with Uber. Image titled Apply to Become an Uber Driver Step 7 7 Enter your social security number. This is required in order to perform a background check. You cannot become an Uber driver without a social security number. The background check is free, and may take a week to process. There is no credit check involved. Image titled Apply to Become an Uber Driver Step 8 8 Upload the required documents. After entering your social security number, you'll be prompted to upload copies of your required documents. You can take clear pictures with your smartphone or digital camera and then transfer them to your computer for upload, or you can use a scanner. [2] Make sure that the pictures are clear and that all of the text on your ID and documents are legible. You'll need to upload your driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. The vehicle registration and the insurance must both be in your name. Some cities may require additional documents, such as a business license or minicab licence. Image titled Apply to Become an Uber Driver Step 9 9 Download the Uber Driver app for your smartphone. You can have a link to the app sent to you, or you can search for the \"Uber Driver\" app on your device's app store. You'll need an iPhone 4s or newer or an Android running 4.0+. Windows Phone and Blackberry are not supported for the Uber Driver app. If you don't have a compatible smartphone, you may be able to rent one from Uber. Follow the link on the app download screen during the sign up process for details. Image titled Apply to Become an Uber Driver Step 10 10 Enter your direct deposit information. In order to receive your Uber payments directly to your account, you can enter your checking account information for direct deposit. Visit vault.uber.com and log in with your Uber account.
